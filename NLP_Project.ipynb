              "'what uncle paul proposes to talk about in these talks that we shall have together said uncle paul as he sat with his nephews one evening in may under the big elder tree in the garden i propose to designate as friends those forms of animal life that though not domesticated or cared for by us nevertheless come to our aid by waging war on insects and various other devouring creatures which would in the end unless their excessive multiplication were kept in restraint by others besides ourselves eat up all our crops and lay waste our fields and it is these ravagers of the farmers carefully tilled acres that i shall speak of as foes what can mans efforts avail against those voracious hordes multiplying as they do every year to an extent beyond calculation will he have the patience the skill the keenness of vision necessary for waging successful warfare on the tiniest species often the most formidable when the junebug despite its far greater size baffles all his endeavors will he undertake to examine his fields and inspect every lump of soil every spear of wheat every separate leaf on his fruittrees for so prodigious a task the whole human race would be inadequate even if it united all its efforts to this one end the devouring hordes would reduce us to starvation my children had we not able helpers to work for us helpers endowed with a patience that nothing can tire a skill that foils all ruses a vigilance that nothing escapes to lie in ambush for the enemy to track it to its remotest retreats to hunt it unceasingly and finally to exterminate itthat is their sole care their neverending occupation urged on by the pangs of hunger they are relentless in their pursuit both for their own sake and on behalf of their progeny they live on those that live on us they are the enemies of our enemies engaged in this work are the martins that just at present are circling over our heads the bats that fly around our house the owls that call to one another from the hollow willow trunks in the meadow the warblers that sing in the grove the frogs that croak in the ditches and many more besides including the toad which is an object of loathing to most people thanks be to god who has given us to serve as guardians of our daily bread the owl and the toad the bat and the viper the frog and the lizard all these creatures wrongfully cursed and shamefully abused by us and foolishly looked upon with repugnance and hatred in reality lend us valiant assistance and should take a high place in our esteem to repair the injustice they have suffered shall be my first duty as we come to each of them in turn thanks be to god who to protect us from that great eater the insect has given us the swallow and the warbler the robin redbreast and the nightingale these the delight of our eye and ear creatures of infinite gracemust i again raise my voice in their defense alas yes for their homes are ravaged by the barbarous nesthunter it is my purpose now to acquaint you my children with these various helpers of man in his labors as tiller of the soil i will tell you about their ways of living their habits and their aptitudes and the services they render us my object will be attained if i succeed in imparting to you a little of the interest they deserve i will begin with those that have teeth but first let us take a glance at the shape and structure of teeth in general for it is this that determines the kind of food required by the animal teeth is it not true resumed uncle paul that each kind of work demands its own special tool the plowman must have the plow the blacksmith the anvil the mason the trowel the weaver the shuttle the carpenter the plane and these different tools all excellent for the work to which they are applied would be of no use in any other could the mason roughcast his wall with a shuttle could the weaver weave his cloth with a trowel evidently not is it not true then that from the tool one may easily guess the kind of work it does nothing could be easier it seems to me replied jules if i see planes and saws hanging on the wall i know that i am in a carpenters shop and i should know said emile from seeing an anvil a hammer and a pair of tongs that i was in a blacksmiths shop but if i saw a mortarboard and a trowel i should look around for the mason well uncle paul went on every creature has its special task in creations great workshop where all take part all work according to the design of divine wisdom each species has its missioni might say its trade to followa trade that requires special tools just as does any work done by man now among the innumerable trades of animals there is one that is common to all without exception the most important trade of all as without it life itself would be impossible it is the business of eating but all animals do not take the same kind of food some need prey raw flesh others fodder some eat roots others seeds and fruit in every instance teeth are the tools used in the work of eating so they must have the shape appropriate to the kind of food eaten whether that be tough or tender hard or easy to chew therefore just as from his tool the artisans work may be inferred so from the shape of its teeth one can usually tell the kind of food eaten by any animal herbivorous animals are those that live on grass fodder hay and carnivorous animals are those that eat flesh the horse the donkey the ox and the sheep are herbivorous the dog the cat and the wolf carnivorous the food of the herbivorous animal is tough hard fibrous and must be ground for a long time by the teeth in order to be reduced to a pastelike mass suitable for swallowing and after that for easy digestion in this case the teeth in both upper and lower jaw must have broad and almost flat surfaces that will come together and grind the food as millstones grind grain on the other hand the flesh eaten by the carnivorous animal is soft easy to swallow and easy to digest all that the animal has to do is to tear it apart and cut it into shreds so the teeth here must have sharp edges that come together and operate like the blades of a pair of scissors i think i have said enough on that subject now which of you will tell me what kind of food goes with each of the teeth i show you here and uncle paul laid before his hearers the two teeth pictured on these pages with others to follow the first tooth said emile is flattened and very wide at the top it must crush and grind by rubbing against a tooth of the same kind in the opposite jaw so it is the tooth of an animal that eats fodder it is indeed uncle paul replied the tooth of an herbivorous animal a horse the second continued emile is composed of several broad points with edges almost as sharp as knife blades it must be meant for cutting flesh those winding folds that you see in the horses toothwhat are they for asked jules there is nothing like them in the wolfs tooth i was going to tell you about them his uncle replied if the horses teeth had perfectly smooth surfaces without any roughness to act as a grater is it not true that in pressing and rubbing each against the opposite tooth they would simply crush the fodder or hay as you would crush it between two smooth stones without changing it into fine powder millstones if they were polished like marble tables would flatten the grain without making flour of it they must be rough on the surface in order to seize the wheat during the grinding of the upper stone on the stationary lower one and to make it into powder when by long use the surface is worn smooth the stones are of no service until they are dented again with the hammer well the folds of a horses teeth may be likened to the roughness of a millstone they project a little above the general surface of the tooth making a sort of coarse file that tears to pieces blades of grass or hay when rubbed by the opposite tooth i think i see a danger threatening the herbivorous animal put in jules at this point those projecting folds must soon be worn down by rubbing against one another just the same as the roughness on the millstone if smooth millstones cant make flour without being roughened again no more can the herbivorous animals worn teeth go on grinding that is provided for admirably provided for my boy everything in the world is arranged so that it can do its work a wisdom that nothing escapes watches over the smallest details everything even to a donkeys jaw shows this to be so listen and judge for yourselves there are two different substances in a tooth one very hard a little like glass and called enamel the other quicker to wear out but very difficult to break and known as ivory these two substances are combined in different ways according to the animals diet in the horse the sheep the ox the donkey and many other herbivorous animals the ivory makes up the main part of the tooth while the harder substance the enamel extends in winding sheets throughout the former projecting a little above its surface in a fold which varies in form in the different kinds of animals so then it is the enamel a substance as hard as a pebble that composes the folds in the herbivorous animals teeth from the rubbing of the lower teeth against the upper the ivory wears away faster than the enamel so that the folds of the latter embedded in the mass of the tooth have their cutting edges brought above the general level as fast as required and thus the grinding surfaces are kept in constant repair you see how it is in the donkeys foodmill for instance the millstones reroughen themselves as fast as necessary for the chewing of a thistle the machinery is selfrepairing even while at work what you tell us uncle is wonderful commented jules i never should have guessed that such an arrangement was necessary for chewing a thistle and only the other day put in louis i kicked out of my way a jawbone that was lying in the road how gladly should i have looked at it closely if i had known all these things ignorance always kicks things aside like that my boy but science is interested in everything knowing that it can always learn something but let us return to the teeth of the carnivorous animals and examine those of the wolf here the irregularities of the nutmeggrater the parallel ridges of the file and the roughness of the millstone would be of no use since the animals food is to be torn into shreds and not chewed into paste for the wolfs food cutting blades are neededsharp scissors which are hard enough not to become blunt hence the working edges of the wolfs teeth are not flat like millstones but shaped rather like pointed chisels the ivory forms the central body of the tooth making it tough and strong while the enamel harder but more brittle is spread as a continuous layer over the tooth and furnishes the requisite cutting edges in like manner a skilful cutler when he wishes to make an edged tool that will cut well and at the same time withstand violent blows makes its central mass of iron a tough material that bears considerable violence without injury but is not hard enough to furnish a keen cutting edge he then overlays it to obtain such an edge with fine steel which combines excessive hardness with the fragility of glass the best that man can contrive in the making of edged tools is met with in perfection in the teeth of carnivorous animals if i understand you then said jules ivory which is not so hard as enamel but less brittle forms the interior of the teeth of carnivorous animals and enamel which is harder and more brittle forms the outside layer ivory makes the teeth strong enamel makes them cut yes that is it now i dont know which is the more wonderful the donkeys or the wolfs set of teeth both are wonderful as both are admirably adapted to the kind of work they have to do what surprises me most emile interposed is that a lot of things we should never pay any attention to turn out to be very interesting when uncle paul explains them to us i never should have thought that the time would come when i should listen with pleasure to the history of a tooth since that interests you said uncle paul i will continue the subject a little further and will tell you about human teeth about yours my boy so white and so well arranged and so admirably adapted for biting a slice of bread and butter the different shapes of teeth man has thirtytwo teeth sixteen to each jaw uncle paul continued emile already had his finger in his mouth passing it from one tooth to another to count them his uncle paused until he had finished the count but i have only twenty all told declared the boy twenty and not thirtytwo the other twelve will come some day my boy at present you have the right number of teeth for a child of your age they do not all come at one time but one after another we begin with twenty and no more they are called milk teeth or first teeth when we are about seven years old they begin to fall out and are replaced by others stronger and set in more firmly in addition to this second score of teeth there appear later twelve others bringing the total number up to thirtytwo those farthest back in the inmost cavity of the mouth come late when we are eighteen or twenty years old or even older for which reason they are called wisdom teeth to signify that they appear at an age when the reason is well developed these thirtytwo last teeth constitute the second cutting i call them last because they are never replaced by any others if we lose them that is the end of our teeth no more will come i have two now that are loose said emile they must come out soon to leave room for the new teeth that are to take their place the others will get loose too and the twenty that you have now will be succeeded by twenty others to which sooner or later will be added twelve more which come only once these last occupy the back part of the jaws three on each side top and bottom thus the final number will be thirtytwo these thirtytwo teeth are divided into three classes according to their shape and the work they must do the same names being repeated top and bottom and right and left i show you merely the eight teeth of half a jaw in every tooth there are two parts to be distinguished the crown and the root the root is the part that is embedded in the jawbone like a nail hammered into wood the crown is the part that comes into view and it may be likened to the head of a nail the root holds the tooth in place fixes it firmly the crown cuts tears and grinds the food in the two front teeth in each halfjaw the crown grows thinner toward the top the edge is straight and sharp fitted for cutting food dividing it into small mouthfuls therefore these teeth are called incisors from the latin incidere meaning to cut their root is a simple pivot the next tooth is called canine its root is a little longer than those of the preceding teeth and its crown is slightly pointed the dog the cat the wolf and carnivorous animals in general have this tooth shaped like a powerful fang which serves to catch and hold prey but above all acts as a weapon in attack and defense it is the canine teeth that you see crossing one another long and pointed two on each side when you raise the upper lip of a cat or a dog because of these remarkable fangs of carnivorous animals especially the dog which in latin is canis the name canine has been given to the teeth that in man are like them if not in form and use at least in the position they occupy the next five teeth are the most useful of all they are called molars from the latin mola a millstone because they play the part of millstones in grinding the food for this purpose their crowns are blunt and broad and slightly irregular not flat like the horses molars or with sharp cutting edges like the wolfs because mans food is not composed exclusively of either vegetables or flesh but of both at the same time for food as varied as mans there is need of molars fit for all sorts of service they must grind like those of the herbivorous animals and cut like those of the carnivorous in short they must be like those of both and indeed their wide crowns are suited to vegetable food and their rather sharp irregularities are adapted to animal food the first two are called little molars or in more learned language bicuspids because they have each two cusps or points they are the least strong of the five and have only one root each the two little molars the canine tooth and the two incisors of each halfjaw are the only teeth that are renewed multiply them by four and you will have the twenty teeth of the first cutting teeth that begin to fall out toward the age of seven and are gradually replaced by others that is the state of emiles teeth at present there being but twenty of them the other three teeth in each halfjaw come only once they are the large molars of which the very end one is also called the wisdom tooth as in the act of mastication the large molars have to bear strong pressure the root is composed of several pivots or prongs reaching down each into a special cavity or socket this makes them strong and firm so that they can stand pressure both downward and sideways to sum up the grown man has thirtytwo teeth in all sixteen to each jaw namely four incisors two canines and ten molars these last are divided into four bicuspids or little molars and six large molars the milk teeth do not include these last six here jules had a question to ask ivory and enamel said he those two substances of different degrees of hardness that you told us were arranged in such a wonderful way in horses and wolves teethare they in our teeth too yes they are there ivory forms the entire root which must serve as a firm support and it also fills the crown while enamel merely covers the outside as a hard protecting layer i am going to get the cat and look at her teeth said emile has she twenty like me or has she thirtytwo neither twenty nor thirtytwo but thirty when fullgrown dogs and wolves have fortytwo horses and donkeys fortyfour in fact the number varies with different animals as much as the shape perhaps a few words on this subject will not be out of place first here is the picture of a wolfs mouth if one did not already know one could easily guess the animals diet by merely looking at its teeth those deeply indented molars those strong curved caninessurely they call for wild prey and show great strength the whole set indicates clearly enough a carnivorous appetite at i are the incisors six in number they are small and of slight use for the animal does not cut its prey into little mouthfuls but swallows it gluttonously in great strips at c are the canines veritable daggers which the bandit plunges into the sheeps neck the little molars are at m the large molars come next the first marked r is the strongest and it is with this that the wolf and the dog crack the hardest bones finally the picture shows the salivary glands that is the organs that prepare the saliva and let it ooze into the mouth through the canal s as the animal eats without dwelling on this point which would take me too far from my subject i will merely say that saliva serves to soak the food and make a soft mouthful that can be easily swallowed and it also plays an important part in the stomach in reducing to a fluid pap the food taken in that is to say it helps to digest the food let us pass on to the cat another typical flesheater six small incisors are ranged in the front of the jaw like a row of elegant but useless pearls they are ornamental rather than useful to the animal a mousehunter needs very long and pointed canines for piercing the prey seized by the claws in this respect the cat is armed in a very formidable manner what do you think of it louis i think he replied a rat must be very uncomfortable between those curved canines the picture shows us one day said emile when i was pulling the cats mustache she gave me a bite that felt like the sharp prick of a needle it was done so quickly i had no time to draw my hand back the cat brought her canines into play and wounded you with one of them as quickly as a steel point could have done now look at the molars there are four above the last one very small and three below their cusps or points are still sharper than the wolfs so too the cats appetitelike that of its kindred the tiger the panther the jaguar and othersdemands more flesh than that of the wolf and animals like it such as the fox the jackal and especially the dog have you ever noticed how disdainful the cat is when you throw her only a piece of bread scarcely has she smelt it when she makes a movement of superb scorn tail in the air back raised and looks at you as if to say are you making fun of me i want something else or if very hungry she reluctantly bites the bread chews it awkwardly and swallows it with distaste the dog on the contrary our good azor for example catches the bread joyfully in his mouth without letting it touch the ground and if he finds any fault with the piece it is for being too small you call the cat a glutton i take her part and maintain that it is not the vice of gluttony she shows but that her teeth must have meat what could you expect her pointed canines and keenedged molars to do with a crust of bread they demand above all a prey that bleeds a quivering bit of flesh what a difference between the teeth of the hunter and those of the peaceful chewer of grass let us examine this picture of a horses head here the incisors six in number are powerful they seize the forage and cut it a mouthful at a time the canines of no use here show only as little knobs on the jawbone next beyond comes a long vacant space called the bar that is where the bit is held in the horses mouth back of the bar you see the real grinding mechanism composed of twelve pairs of strong molars with square flat crowns furnished with slightly projecting folds whose usefulness i have already pointed out to you if i am not much mistaken here we have a mill capable of grinding tough straw and fibrous hay finally here is a rabbits head each jaw is furnished with two enormous incisors set deep into the bone bent backward above and ending each in a sharpedged crown what are such incisors as those made for i know jules quickly replied the rabbit is always nibbling for want of better food it will gnaw the bark of a tree and even the wood it uses its incisors to cut its food very fine to gnaw it to gnaw itthat is the right word hence we give the name of rodents or gnawers to the various animals having incisors of that kind such are the squirrel the hare the rabbit the rat and the mouse those poor creatures which must gnaw the toughest vegetable substances and fill their bellies with wood paper rags even when there is nothing better for supplying the mill that is kept always going but it is not merely to satisfy their hunger that these animals are almost incessantly gnawing there is another reason for their doing it their incisors grow all their lives and tend to lengthen indefinitely consequently the animal must wear them away by continual friction as otherwise their crowns would at last so far overlap that they could not be made to meet then the poor beast would be unable to seize its food and would perish in order to be able to eat when hungry the rat and the rabbit must eat when not hungry so as to sharpen their incisors and keep them the right length it is true that they often turn their attention to very poor fodder a splinter of wood a straw a mere nothing suffices to maintain the play of their indefatigable incisors remember children the expressive term rodents which means gnawers applied to a whole class of animals akin to the rabbit and the rat remember their curious incisors for we shall have occasion to speak of them again hereafter for the present let us finish our examination of the rabbits teeth the canines are lacking in their place the jaw shows a bar or in other words a large open space at the extreme back of the mouth are the molars few in number but strong with flat crowns and several folds of enamel in fact they make an excellent grinding machine in giving you these details concerning the different shapes of teeth in different species of animals i wished particularly to point out the following truth each species eats a particular kind of food for which the teeth are especially formed so that one might say of any animal show me its teeth and i will tell you what it eats in many instances where we cannot examine the teeth we do not know what such and such a creature feeds on and in our hasty judgment we mistake a friend for an enemy a helper for a destroyer if the animal is ugly we condemn it on the spot and hate it accusing it of any number of misdeeds we declare war against it and never suspect in our foolishness that it is a war at our own expense but there is a very simple precaution by which we can avoid these regrettable mistakes let us yield to no prejudice however widespread and before condemning an animal as harmful let us find out what sort of teeth it has they will tell us the animals way of living as you shall soon see for yourselves bats which of you three can tell me what bats feed upon asked uncle paul the next day at this question emile put on his thinkingcap closing his eyes and rubbing his forehead but no ideas came nor were jules and louis any prompter with an answer nobody knows well then so much the better for you will have the satisfaction of finding it out for yourselves from the shape of the teeth the incisors small and weak which you see on an enlarged scale in this picture of a bats set of teethdo they look as if they were made for gnawing vegetable substances after the manner of rats and rabbits could they cut any such tough fodder certainly not replied jules they are too weak to be of much use and then it seems to me those two sharp curved fangs must belong to a flesheating animal the long pointed canines do indicate as much but the molars show it perhaps still more plainly with their strong and sharp indented crowns fitting so well into the sharpedged depressions of the opposite jaware those molars designed to crush grain to grind slowly and patiently fibrous substances no said jules they are the teeth of a flesheater not the gristmill of an herbivorous animal i am sure now affirmed louis that the bat lives on prey it is a greedy hunter of flesh and blood emile declared the cats teeth are not more savagelooking all that is quite correct said uncle paul the teeth have taught you the chief thing about the animals habits yes the bat is a hunter an eater of live prey a little ogre always demanding fresh meat it only remains to find out the kind of game it likes evidently the size of the prey must suit the size of the hunter a bats head is no bigger than a large hazelnut it is true the mouth is split from ear to ear and can when wide open swallow mouthfuls larger than the smallness of the animal would lead one to suppose nevertheless the bat can attack only small creatures what can it be that it goes chasing through the air when after sunset it flies hither and thither unceasingly gnats perhaps and nightmoths jules suggested exactly those are its prey the bat lives on insects exclusively all are food for its maw hardwinged beetles slender mosquitoes plump moths flying insects of all sorts in fact all the little winged foes of our cereals vines fruittrees woolen stuffsall those creatures of the air that come in the evening attracted by our lighted rooms and singe their wings in the flames of our lamps who would undertake to say how many insects bats destroy when they fly around a house the game is so small and the hunter is so hungry notice what happens on a calm summer evening lured abroad by the balmy atmosphere of the twilight hours a host of insects leave their lurkingplaces and come forth guests at lifes garden party to sport together in the air hunt for food and mate with one another it is the hour when the sphinxmoths fly abruptly from flower to flower and thrust their long probosces into the depths of the corollas where honey is stored the hour when the mosquito thirsting for human blood sounds its warcry in our ears and selects our tenderest spot to stab with its poisoned lancet the hour when the junebug leaves the shelter of the leaf spreads its buzzing wings and goes humming through the air in quest of its fellows the gnats dance in joyous swarms which the slightest breath of wind disperses like a column of smoke butterflies and moths in weddinggarments their wings powdered with silvery dust and their antennæ spread out like plumes join in the frolic or seek places in which to deposit their eggs the woodborer comes forth from its hidden retreat under the bark of the elm the weevil breaks its cell hollowed out in a grain of wheat the plumemoths rise in clouds from the granaries and fly toward the fields of ripe cereals other moths explore here the grapevines there the peartrees appletrees cherrytrees busily seeking food and shelter for their evil progeny but in the midst of these festive assemblies suddenly there comes a killjoy it is the bat which flies hither and thither up and down appearing and disappearing darting its head out this side and that and each time snapping up an insect on the wing crushing and swallowing it immediately the hunting is good gnats beetles and moths abound and every now and then a little cry of joy announces the capture of a plump junebug as long as the fading twilight permits the eager hunter thus pursues its work of extermination satisfied at last the bat flies back to its somber and quiet retreat the next evening and all through the summer the hunt is resumed always with the same ardor always at the expense of insects only to give you an idea of the multitude of harmful insects especially of moths from which the bat delivers us i will quote a passage from the celebrated french naturalist buffon the most graphic historian of the animal kingdom but first i must tell you that bats are in the habit of making their homes in old towers grottoes and abandoned quarries there in great numbers they pass the daylight hours hanging motionless from the roof and thence they sally forth at the approach of darkness the floor of these retreats becomes covered at last with a deep layer of droppings from which we can learn the kind of food eaten by bats and judge of the importance of their hunting now here is what buffon has to say of a grotto frequented by these creatures    having one day descended into the grottoes of arci i was     surprised to find there a kind of earth of a singular nature it     formed a bed of blackish matter several feet thick almost entirely     composed of parts of the wings and feet of flies and moths as if     these insects had gathered here in immense numbers coming together     for the express purpose of dying and rotting in company it was     nothing but bats dung that had been accumulating for years what a curious kind of soil made up entirely of the remains of dead insects jules exclaimed i will add that sometimes this soil of flies and moths at the bottom of old quarries and caves is abundant enough for the farmer to take account of it and use it as a rich fertilizer it is called bats guano to make such heaps of it then remarked louis bats must destroy insects by millions and millions five or six dozen flies or moths are hardly enough for a bats evening meal if a few junebugs should make their appearance they would be eagerly snapped up if the band of hunters is a large one judge of the thousands of harmful insects destroyed in a single season next to the birds we have no more valiant helpers than bats and so i beg you to be friendly to these creatures which while we are asleep and perhaps dreaming of our rich crops of pears and apples peaches and grapes and grain proceed with their silent warfare against the enemies of our harvests and every evening destroy by myriads moths mosquitoes beetles bugsin short the greater part of the insect throng that always threatens us with starvation if we do not keep vigilant watch i see now that the bat does us a good turn emile admitted all the same it is frightfully ugly and besides they say if it touches you it will give you the itch there are any number of other sayings about it that are just as foolish my boy one is that the bat pricks with its pointed teeth the shegoats udders so as to suck her blood and milk another is that it gnaws the sausages and bacon hung under the chimney mantel also that its sudden entrance into a house means misfortune i have heard persons cry out because a bat had accidentally grazed them with the tip of its wing and i have seen others pale with terror because they had found one of the innocent creatures fastened by a claw to their bed curtains here as in many other things my dear children you must take into account the folly of mankind which is more given to error than to truth if you were old enough to understand me i should add that wherever i find a general agreement that a thing is black i think it well to look into the matter and find out whether on the contrary it may not be white we are so stuffed with false notions that very often the exact opposite of the common belief is the real truth do you ask for examples there are plenty of them the sun we generally say according to all appearances revolves from east to west around the stationary earth no says science no it is the earth on the contrary that rotates from west to east before the stationary sun the stars we say again are small bright points little lamps in the arch of the firmament no answers science the stars are not tiny sparks they are enormous bodies which compare in light and size to the sun itself a million and a half times as large as the earth the bat it is commonly asserted is a harmful hideous venomous creature of ill omen that must be crushed without mercy under the heel no affirms science a thousand times no the bat is an inoffensive creature that instead of doing us harm and bringing misfortune renders us an immense service by protecting the good things of the earth from their countless destroyers no we should not vent our hatred upon it and pitilessly kill it on the contrary we should like and respect it as one of our best helpers the poor creature does not deserve the bad reputation that ignorance has given it its touch does not communicate either lice or the itch its teeth do not pierce the goats udders or attack our stores of bacon its chance entrance into a room is no more to be dreaded than a butterflys for my part i should like to have it visit my bedroom often at night for then i should soon be rid of the mosquitoes that torment me all things considered we have nothing absolutely nothing to reproach it with and we are indebted to it for very valuable services that is the answer of science to ignorant prejudice henceforth then crush the bat under your heel if you dare i will take good care said louis never to do such a thing now that i know what an army of enemies we are guarded against by the bat but what a pity jules remarked that it is such a hideous creature hideous his uncle repeated that is a slander which i hope to make you take back surely you cant deny that the bat is horribly ugly persisted the boy perhaps i can i should like to know said emile how you can make out that the frightful shape of the creature is beautiful to discuss ugliness and beauty with you my children replied uncle paul is not an undertaking that i should care to enter upon to follow me in such a discussion you would need a maturity of mind that does not go with your years even if you were grown up it might still be impossible for us to come to an agreement inasmuch as it is not with the bodily eyes that ugliness and beauty should be judged but with the eyes of reason ripened by reflection and study and free from the trammels of first impressions which are generally erroneous also how few possess that intellectual clearness of vision that remains untroubled by prematurely conceived opinions and can thus contemplate things in all the clarity of truth trusting the testimony of our eyes and yielding to daily habit we call beautiful the creatures whose general structure shows a certain conformity with that of the animals most familiar to us and unthinkingly accepted as standards for all future judgments we call ugly those that differ from these accepted models and if very unlike we call them hideous enlightened reason refuses to be hemmed in by the narrow circle of first impressions it rises above petty prejudices and says to itself nothing is ugly that god has made everything is beautiful everything is perfect in itself as everything is the work of the creator an animals form should not be judged by its greater or less resemblance to the forms that are already familiar to us and serve us as standards of comparison but rather by its fitness for the kind of life for which it was created where the structure is in perfect harmony with the functions to be performed there too is beauty from this higher point of view ugliness no longer exists or rather it exists all too abundantly but only in the moral world intemperance laziness stupid prideall forms of vice in shortconstitute ugliness and hideousness to tell the truth i know of none besides but i must return to the bat if not in the hope of making you find it beautiful at least with the certainty of interesting you in its remarkable structure i will wager too that not one of you knows what a bat is it is a kind of bird declared emile it is an old rat that has grown a pair of wings jules ventured to assert you are both talking nonsense returned their uncle that is the way with us all we speak at random of animals and persons giving to one our esteem to another our scorn without knowing what they are what they do what they are good for you dont know the first thing about the bat and yet you overwhelm the poor animal with abuse the bat has nothing in common with birds it has neither beak nor feathers nor is it a rat that has acquired wings in its old age it is really a peculiar creature that is born lives and dies with wings without in any way belonging to the bird family its body has the size the fur and somewhat the shape of a mouse but its wings are bare the most highly organized animals have as a distinctive mark teats or udders which furnish milk the first food of their young these animals do not feed their young family from the beak as birds do they do not abandon their offspring to all the hazards of good or ill fortune careless of their future as do the stupid races of reptiles and fish the females rear their young with maternal care feeding them from time to time with milk from their udders all the various species that suckle their young all that are provided with udders are classed together by men of learning and called mammals from the latin mamma a breast or teat i will add that in the great majority of instances these animals have the body covered with fur or hair and not with feathers or scales feathers belong to birds scales to reptiles and fishes as examples of mammals you will immediately think of our domestic animals the dog the cat the cow the sheep the goat the horse and others i have often noticed said emile how carefully the cat raises her family while the kittens press her teats with their little pink paws to make the milk flow faster the old cat washes them with her tongue and shows her happiness by her soft purring well then resumed uncle paul the bat is a mammal just as much as is the cat and like that of the cat its body is protected from the cold by fur and the female has teats for nursing her little ones the number of teats varies widely in the different kinds of animals being greater in the species that have many young at a birth and less in the others which is as it should be in order that the nurslings may all be suckled at the same time the bat has only two situated on the breast and not under the stomach the female bears only a single young one at a time emile rightly admires the love of the cat for her kittens yet the bat is a still tenderer mother when in the evening she goes out in search of food instead of leaving her nursling in some hole in the wall after suckling it she carries it with her clinging to her breast and it is while weighted with this load that she chases the nimble moths on the wing doubtless the pursuit of prey is thus rendered less fruitful and more difficult but no matter the loving mother prefers not to abandon her feeble charge and allows it to continue peacefully sucking during the evolutions of the hunt with the deepening darkness the bat regains its retreat suspends itself from the roof by a toenail and holds its nursling by wrapping it in her wings that is not so bad a way to behave admitted jules i begin to find the bat less ugly than i thought that is what i just told you returned his uncle ugliness is begotten of ignorance it diminishes as knowledge increases but let us continue our theme the bats wings wings real wings perfectly adapted to flying are the bats most striking feature how can a mammal an animal whose general structure is that of a dog or a cat for example possess the flyingapparatus of a bird how can two organs so entirely different be combined in the bats wing my children we find an admirable example of the infinite resources at the command of the creator who without adding to or subtracting from the fundamental plan has adapted the same organs to the most widely different functions the fore feet of mammalsof the dog or the cat we will sayare changed into wings in the bat without the addition or the loss of a single part in this incredible transformation more than that the human arms our arms childrenare there represented piece by piece bone by bone you all look at me as if you did not believe it unable to understand how there can be anything in common between our arms and a bats wings the fact is jules confessed it takes all my faith in your words to make me admit that there can be the least likeness between a mans arm and a bats wing i do not propose to make you admit it because of your faith in me i propose to prove it to you follow along your arm so as to grasp the demonstration better from the shoulder to the elbow the framework of the human arm consists of a bone known as the humerus from the elbow to the wrist there are two bones of unequal size running side by side the whole length the larger is the cubitus the smaller the radius then comes the wrist composed of several little bones which i will not now describe next is the palm of the hand its framework formed of a row of five bones almost alike and each serving to support a finger finally each finger contains a succession of small bones called phalanges of which the thumb has two and all the others three each i will add that two bones serve to attach the arm to the body one is the shoulderblade a broad triangular bone situated on the back behind the shoulder the other is the collar bone slender and curved situated in front and extending from the shoulder to the base of the neck those are the collarbones that you can feel with your hand at the right and left above the breast while thus enumerating the parts of the arm uncle paul guided the hand of each listener and made it feel the several bones as they were named emile had some difficulty with the learned terms humerus and cubitus which he now heard for the first time nevertheless by paying close attention he found that he could easily remember them when the boys had all learned the name and the position of each bone in the human arm their uncle continued now examine with me this picture of a bats skeleton the bone marked o is the shoulderblade as with us it forms the back of the shoulder and it is triangular wide and flat then the part marked cl is the shoulder and the bone that goes from there to the base of the neck is the collarbone queried emile precisely i see how the rest goes louis hastened to interpose the bone marked h is the humerus and the elbow is at the angle made by this bone with the next my turn now put in jules the two bones running side by side from the elbow to the wrist are marked cu and r the first is the cubitus the other the radius consequently ca is the wrist but there i get lost the wrist i told you explained uncle paul is composed of several small bones that structure we find at ca the bats wrist but then the hand queried jules the palm of the hand and the five fingers which it supports are represented by the ribs of the wing and by po which is the thumb this is the shortest of the five fingers as with man it forms no part of the framework of the wing but is free and is furnished with a hooked nail which the animal uses to cling by and also in walking finally this thumb has two phalanges as in the human thumb and at the base is a small bone which in man forms a part of the palm of the hand so much for the thumb now let us look at those four long bones that start from the wrist ca and spread out through the greater part of the wing together with the similar but shorter bone of the thumb they represent the series of five bones composing the framework of the human palm next come the fingers with their phalanges ph in short except for a few slight differences the bats wing reproduces piece by piece the structure of the human arm yes jules admitted its all there even to the small bones of the wrist and fingers is it possible that a poor bat can pattern after us so closely the horrid creature copies our arms to make itself wings your pride need not suffer from this close resemblance which you will find in different degrees in a multitude of other animals especially among the mammals our next of kin in bodily structure in the formation of his body man enjoys no monopoly the dog the cat the donkey the oxeach and all of themshare with us a common stock of organs modified in details and suited to the kind of life of each species we recognize in the bats wings the fundamental plan of our arms we see it also no less plainly in the fore legs of the cat the dog and many other animals and we can trace a rude resemblance to our hand even in the donkeys homely hoof i tell you these things my children not to lessen in your eyes the undeniable superiority of man but to inspire in you a fellow feeling for animals that are formed like us suffer as we do and are far too often the victims of our stupid cruelty whoever needlessly causes an animal to suffer commits a barbarous act an inhuman act inasmuch as he inflicts torture on flesh like our own he brutally misuses a body having the same mechanism as our own and the same power of suffering as to our superiority it is established preëminently by an exceptional characteristic that places us above all comparison even with creatures that in their physical structure most closely resemble us this characteristic is reason the torch that lights us in our search for truth it is the human soul which alone knows itself and enjoys the sublime privilege of knowing its divine author in bats four of the five bones similar to those of our palm are greatly elongated as are also the corresponding fingers and they together constitute the four ribs on which is stretched the membrane of the wing just as silk is stretched on the ribs of an umbrella thus it is at the sacrifice of what might have been a hand that the wing is formed therefore the scientists call all mammals of like structure with the bat chiropters meaning handwinged creatures from two greek words signifying hand and wing of the five fingers one only the thumb is left free in the bat and it is very small it is furnished as i said before with a nail or claw the four others destitute of nails are lengthened to serve as supports to the membrane of the wing this membrane is a fold of the skin which starts from the shoulder stretches between the four long fingers of the hand and then attaches itself to the hind leg the toes of which are all furnished with hooked nails or claws and do not depart from the ordinary shape of such members by virtue of the free thumb already described the wings are able to serve as feet in walking when these members are folded close to the animals sides the bat grips the ground by thrusting in first the right claw and then the left and pushes itself forward with its hind feet in laborious and awkward leaps thus it gets over the ground at what might be called a fast pace but is soon tired out with the exertion hence it does not walk except when sure it will not be molested or when it is compelled to do so by its position on a level surface where it cannot launch itself into the air then as soon as possible it gains an elevated point from which it flies off for in order to unfold the hampering membranes that serve as wings and to throw itself into the air the bat needs considerable free space which it cannot get except by hurling itself from a height consequently in the caves inhabited by bats they never fail to secure an unimpeded drop with the hooked talons of a hind foot they cling to the roof head downward that is the way they rest the way they sleep at the slightest alarm the claw lets go the wings spread and the animal is off what a queer way to sleep emile exclaimed hanging from the roof by one foot head downward and do they stay that way long without getting tired if necessary a good half of the year when he went to bed that night emile thought again of the bats way of sleeping but he preferred his own the bats senses of smell and hearing bats are nocturnal uncle paul continued the next day that is they leave their lurkingplaces only at nightfall to hunt in the evening twilight as a rule animals addicted to nocturnal hunting have very large eyes that take in as much light as possible and thus these animals can see with very little light nightbirds such as owls of all kinds will furnish us a remarkable example a little later by a singular exception however despite their nocturnal habits bats have very small eyes how then are they able to direct themselves in their swift flight so abrupt in its changes of direction how above all are they aware of the presence of their tiny gamemoths and gnats they are guided especially by their senses of smell and hearing which are extraordinarily acute what do you say to the bats ears in this picture what animal of its size can show anything like them how they flare like enormous hearingtrumpets to receive the slightest sound the bat that bears them has the expressive name of longeared bat longeared bat repeated jules thats the kind of name i like it describes the animal and shows what there is about it that is out of the ordinary such prodigious ears are certainly made to hear sounds inaudible to us by reason of their excessive faintness they enable their possessor to hear at a distance the beating of a moths wings and the fluttering of a gnat dancing in the air other bats which have smaller ears have as a substitute a sense of smell unequaled for its acuteness the high state of perfection of this sense is the result of the abnormal development of the nose which covers a good part of the face and gives the animal a very strange appearance for example here is the head of a bat called the horseshoe bat this broad distended formation of curious shape that occupies almost the whole space between the eyes and the mouth is the nose it ends above in a large triangular leaflike expanse laterally it spreads out in folded laminæ all together taking the shape of a horseshoe whence the name of the creature what odor however faint could escape such a nose the dog so famous for its keenness of scent chases the hare without seeing it guided solely by the odor left behind by the animal heated in the chase but how much keener the scent of the horseshoe bat must be when it chases in the same manner a moth that leaves no odor for any nose but its pursuers i sometimes wonder whether such a nose so abnormally developed may not be able to detect certain qualities that are and always will be unknown to us for want of the means to perceive them the horseshoe bats grotesque nose makes you laugh my little friends it makes me think i think of the thousand secrets that nature hides from our senses and that would be as easy for us to learn as they would be valuable if we possessed the scent of a poor bat perhaps who can tell the horseshoe bat foresees with its nose the coming storm several days in advance it may scent the future hurricane smell the rainclouds coming from the other end of the earth know by detecting their odor what winds are about to blow foretell in similar manner what the weather is going to be and guided by perceptions of which we can form no idea it may make its plans for hunting insects that are sometimes abundant and sometimes scarce according to the state of the atmosphere if the horseshoe bats nose can do all that said jules we must agree that it is a firstrate sort of nose i make no positive assertions his uncle rejoined i merely have my suspicions the only thing that seems to me beyond doubt is that such an organ as the bats nose serves its owner as a source of sensations unknown to man you say so many wonderful things about it uncle emile interposed that i shall end by thinking the horseshoe bats nose much more curious than ugly theres another thing too ive just noticed why does the creature have such fat cheeks see what a puffedup face it has in the picture with the bat uncle paul explained the chase is a short one lasting only one or two hoursin fact the short interval between sunset and dark the remainder of the twentyfour hours is passed in rest in the quiet of some cavern or grotto does the animal then have but one meal in all this time and what if there are evenings when hunting is out of the question the sky being overcast the wind too strong or rain falling so that the insects keep under cover the bat would then be subjected to long fasts if it were impossible for it to lay in supplies beforehand but these supplies must be collected hastily on the wing with no interruption to the hunt which lasts so short a time hence it is that pouches are indispensable deep pouches in which the hunter can put his game as fast as he catches it the cheeks exactly fill this office they can be enlarged at the creatures willdistended so as to form roomy pockets in which the insects killed with a snap of the teeth can be stowed away these reserve pockets are called cheekpouches gluttonous monkeys have them that is where the sheape fond of sweets puts the lump of sugar given her and lets it slowly melt so as to prolong the enjoyment of it well when the bat is out hunting it first satisfies its hunger and thenespecially when its nose the famous nose that we have just been talking about predicts unfavorable weather for the following daysit redoubles its exertions and stows away moth after moth in the depths of its elastic pouches it returns to its quarters with cheeks all distended now without fear of famine it can remain idle for several days if necessary hanging motionless by a hind claw it feeds on its store of provisions nibbling one at a time as hunger prompts the insects softened to taste in the reservoir of its cheeks but it is high time we finished with the bats their history would be too long if i were to tell you all about them i will only ask jules what he thinks now of the animal he at first called hideous frankly uncle answered the boy these creatures interest me now more than they disgust me their singular wings formed at the cost of what might have been hands their prodigious nose and immense ears which make up for their poor eyesight their cheeks swollen so as to make pouches for their supply of foodall these have interested me very much the cheekpouches said emile where the bat puts its game to soak and the nose that scents the coming storm seemed to me the most curious things about the animal and i said louis shall never forget how many enemies bats deliver us from now you understand uncle paul rejoined or at least i hope you are beginning to understand that bats being so useful to us in destroying a multitude of ravaging insects and noteworthy for their singular structure should not inspire us with an unjustifiable repugnance and still less with a stupid rage to exterminate them let us leave in peace these poor creatures that so valiantly earn their living by protecting our crops do not let us harm them under the foolish pretext that they are ugly for their supposed ugliness is in reality an admirable adaptation of bodily structure to the creatures mode of life the hedgehog in his walled garden uncle paul allowed a couple of hedgehogs which he had brought from the neighboring hills to wander at large one evening the children noticed them poking about in a lettuce patch why asked emile has uncle paul put those animals in the garden and told us to leave them alone if we happened to come across them no doubt to make war on harmful insects answered louis stop look there one of them is turning up the earth with its little black snout ssh lets keep still and see what its after the children crouched down behind a row of peas so as not to be seen the hedgehog now scratching with its paws now rummaging with the tip of its snout which resembles that of a pig finally unearthed a big fat white larva which had probably been clinging to the root of a lettuce plant the children ran to look at the captured game the hedgehog thus taken by surprise hastened to roll itself up into a ball bristling with spines in the disinterred worm jules easily recognized a junebug larva one of that ravenous and destructive race that uncle paul had already told them about 1 in the evening when they were all gathered together the hedgehog naturally became the subject of conversation several years ago said uncle paul as i was returning home one evening at a late hour i chanced upon two hedgehogs coming out from a pile of stones i tied them up in my handkerchief so as to bring them home and let them loose in my garden ever since then they have never failed to render me certain services that you can appreciate by examining the jaws in this picture pointed teeth like those jules remarked were never made for browsing grass the hedgehog must feed on prey its teeth are just right for crunching junebug worms such as i saw dug up in the garden this morning notice how sharp the points of the teeth are resumed his uncle both in the upper and in the lower jaw those two rows of teeth fit into each other when the animal bites and they plunge like so many fine daggers into the captured victims flesh with this complicated dental mechanism evidently the hedgehog cannot triturate tough food it must have a kind of diet that is soft juicy capable of being reduced to marmalade by a brief chewing the animal is therefore preëminently a flesheater several other species particularly the mole and the shrewmouse of these regions have like the hedgehog teeth tapering to conical points and interplaying in the two jaws their food too is about the same as the hedgehogs all threehedgehog mole and shrewmouselive on small gameinsects larvæ slugs caterpillars worms they belong to the group of mammals known to naturalists as the order of insectivorous animals or in other words the order of insecteaters on and under the ground they carry on the same kind of hunt that bats do in the air in their way of living bats too are insectivorous but their peculiar bodily structure causes them to be placed apart in the order of chiropters thus the mammals furnish us two orders of helpers the chiropters which hunt on the wing and the insecteatersthe insectivorous animals properly so calledwhich hunt on and under the ground to the latter belong the hedgehog the mole and the shrewmouse the hedgehog the largest of the three requires the largest and most plentiful prey tiny vermin are disdained but a junebug larva or a good fat molecricket is an excellent find when they are not buried too deep he digs with his paws and snout to unearth them you have today seen my hedgehogs at work in the lettuce bed all night they go prowling about the garden sniffing and rummaging in every nook and corner and crunching no small number of my foes without doing me much harm in them i have two vigilant watchmen who make their rounds every night for the greater security of my growing vegetables however despite the interest i take in them i must to be candid acknowledge their faults the hedgehogs natural food consists unquestionably of insects but when a good opportunity presents itself the greedy creature is easily tempted by larger and more highly flavored prey in its wild state the hedgehog does not hesitate to suck the blood of young rabbits caught in their hole during the mothers absence the eggs of quail and partridge too it esteems as a most delicious feast but its supreme delight is to wring the necks of a brood of little chickens one night last year i heard a great commotion in the henhouse the roosters were raising cries of alarm the hens were cackling in desperate fright i ran out to see what the trouble was one of my hedgehogs had crept in under the door and i found the rogue regaling himself on some little chickens almost under their mothers wing she being powerless to help them in the dark with one kick i sent the assassin rolling outside and the next day thorough repairs were taken in hand the holes on a level with the floor were closed up and since then i have had no further trouble from my insecthunters with proper precautions against their thirst for blood i have two larvadevourers of great value for my garden but wont they do damage of another kind asked louis i have heard that hedgehogs climb trees and shake off the ripe fruit and then roll on it so as to spit it with their spines after which they carry it off to their holes and eat it at their ease pay no attention to any such stories my boy it is utterly impossible for a hedgehog to climb a tree clumsy and stubby as it is with legs so short and claws useless for climbing how could it manage an athletic feat that calls for agility hooked claws and supple limbs no my friend the hedgehog does not climb trees neither does it carry off fruit transfixed with its spines the only vestige of truth in that old wives tale is that hedgehogs do not live exclusively on prey if they find fruit that they like on the ground a very ripe pear or a juicy peach for example they munch it with as great contentment as they would a beetle or a junebug it is also said louis added that if kept in a house the hedgehog will drive away rats ah that i am quite willing to believe by day the animal crouches in a corner and sleeps but at night it is on the move always hunting for slugs fat beetles and other insects consequently it may well be that its noisy hunt for prey as it goes poking its pointed snout into every hole and cranny frightens the rats and mice and drives them away especially as the nocturnal prowler exhales a disagreeable odor calculated to betray its presence having neither the cats light paw nor that animals great patience in lying in wait for game the hedgehog does not indulge in hunting rats but if by good luck one falls into its clutches it is accepted with delight for the hedgehogs great feast is blood freshly killed flesh when i wish to give my two hedgehogs a special treat i throw them a bleeding beef liver or a chickens entrails anything of that sort is eagerly devoured tastes so undisguisedly carnivorous tell you what must happen to a mouse caught by one of these animals i attribute to them the disappearance of some nests of rats that used to trouble me to satisfy its devouring hunger the hedgehog appears to attack all sorts of prey alike even planting its teeth in a viper without any thought of the reptiles venom and in still other respects the animal enjoys a remarkable immunity you have seen the spanish fly that magnificent strongsmelling insect that lives on ashtrees and is distinguished by sheath wings of a superb golden green yes i remember it said jules it is used for raising blisters after being dried and ground to powder that is correct if then this powder eats into the skin so readily what effect ought it to have on the delicate lining of the stomach if introduced into that organ what animal could swallow it without suffering torture and speedy death well by an exception that i cannot undertake to explain the hedgehog can feed on this horrible poison without the slightest apparent injury a celebrated russian naturalist pallas has seen it make a meal on spanish flies with no ill results for a repast of that sort a stomach peculiarly constructed is certainly necessary once upon a time there was a king very well known in history named mithridates being aware that he was surrounded by enemies capable of poisoning him some day in order to obviate the danger he gradually accustomed himself to the most noxious drugs by increasing the dose little by little he finally rendered himself immune against poison the hedgehog is the mithridates of the animal kingdom but how far it surpasses the suspicious king without practice it dares swallow the poison of the spanish fly and the vipers deadly venom i like to believe that the hedgehog has not received these exceptional gifts only to leave them unused it must delight to frequent the haunts of the viper in its nocturnal rounds in the underbrush it must occasionally come upon the reptile in its retreat and crush its head with those pointed teeth that are so well adapted to such work what service may it not render in localities infested with this dangerous breed and yet man rages at the hedgehog curses it most heartily and treats it as an unclean beast of no use but to arouse the fury of dogs which cannot attack it because of its spines he subjects it to the torture of an icecold bath to make it unroll itself and if the animal refuses to do so he prods it with a pointed stick goads it disembowels it we will never meddle with hedgehogs uncle paul jules assured him we are too much afraid of snakes to drive away this valiant defender what are the hedgehogs spines asked emile hairs nothing else but very coarse and stiff and pointed like needles together with other hairs fine soft and silky they cover all the upper part of the body the under part has only a coat of soft hair otherwise the animal would wound itself in rolling up into a ball when the hedgehog scents dangerand it is a very wary beastit ducks its head under its stomach draws in its paws and rolls itself into a ball presenting everywhere an armor of spines to the enemy the fox has long been famous for its many ruses the hedgehog has only one but it is always effective who would dare grapple with the creature when it has assumed its attitude of defense the dog refuses after a few luckless essays that make its mouth bleed it declines to go further and contents itself with barking sheltered under the safe cover of its spines the hedgehog turns a deaf ear to these futile threats and remains quiet but if the dog urged on by its master returns to the charge the hedgehog has recourse to a last expedient of war which rarely fails of effect it discharges its strongly offensive urine which flows from the inside of the ball and wets the outside repelled by the unbearable odor of the illsmelling beast and pricked on the nose by its spines even the most eager dog now abandons the attack the enemy gone the hedgehog slowly unrolls itself and trots off to some safe retreat hibernation our bats continued uncle paul live exclusively on insects and these constitute the hedgehogs chief food but it also hunts larger game or even eats fruit in winter there are no longer any plump insects to be had most of them having died after laying their eggs and the few surviving ones having taken refuge from the cold in hidingplaces where they would be very hard to find the larvæ too the hope of future generations are lying torpid far out of sight under the ground in the trunks of old trees snugly hidden away the white worm has bored several feet into the ground to escape the frost there are no more junebugs for the longeared owl no more nightflying moths and no more beetles for the hedgehog what then is to become of these insecteaters they will die of hunger answered jules they would indeed all die were it not for the providential arrangement i am now going to try to make you understand you know the proverb he who sleeps dinesa very true proverb in its simple statement of an undeniable fact well the hedgehog the bat and other animals put the principle into practice with a wisdom quite equal to that of man not being able to dine for want of insects they go to sleep and so deep and heavy is their sleep that to designate it we use a special word lethargy another proverb says as you make your bed so must you lie our dumb animals never lacking in wisdom in ordering their own affairs take good care not to forget this proverb but to adopt wise precautions before abandoning themselves to their long winter sleep the hedgehog chooses for itself a secure retreat amid the great roots of some old tree stump toward the end of the autumn it carries grass and dry leaves to deposit there and arranges them in a hollow ball in the middle of which it rolls itself up and goes to sleep bats assemble in great numbers in the warm depths of some cavern where nothing can disturb their slumbers heads down and bodies packed close together they hug the walls covering them with a sort of velvet tapestry or clinging to one another they hang in bunches from the roof now the winter may do its worst and the winds may rage the hedgehog in its warm blanket of leaves and the bats in their sheltered caves sleep a deep sleep until summer returns and with it insects food animation life but dont they eat anything all winter long asked emile incredulously nothing whatever his uncle assured him then bats and hedgehogs must have a secret for my part i eat more in the winter than at any other time and no amount of sleep would satisfy my hunger yes the bat and the hedgehog have a secret in this matter i am going to tell you this secret but it is a little hard to understand i warn you there is one need before which hunger and thirst are silent however great they may be a need that is never satisfied and is always making itself felt whether we wake or sleep by night by day every hour every minute it is the need of air air is so essential to the maintenance of life that it has not been left to us to regulate its use as we do in regard to food and drink and this is so in order that we may not be exposed to the fatal consequences that would follow the slightest forgetfulness therefore it is with little or no consciousness on our part and independently of our will that air gains entrance into our body to do its marvelous work there on air more than on anything else do we live our daily bread coming only second in the order of importance our need of food is felt at only tolerably long intervals our need of air is felt unceasingly always imperious always inexorable let any one try for a moment to prevent its admission into the body by closing the entrance passages the mouth and the nostrils almost immediately he is suffocated and feels that he would surely die if this state were prolonged a little and what is true of man is true of all forms of animal life air is necessary to them all from the smallest to the greatest what i am going to tell you now will explain this absolute necessity for air for the maintenance of life man and also every animal of a superior organizationa classification that includes mammals and birdshave a temperature of their own a degree of bodily heat peculiar to them a heat resulting from no external conditions but from the functions of life alone whether under a burning sun or in the freezing cold of winter whether subjected to the torrid heat of the equator or to the glacial climate of the poles mans body has a temperature of thirtyeight degrees centigrade and cannot be lowered without danger of death the natural heat of birds attains fortytwo degrees in all seasons and in all climates how is it that this heat is always the same and whence can it come unless from some sort of combustion there is in fact going on within us a perpetual combustion respiration furnishing the necessary air and food supplying the fuel to live is to consume oneself in the strictest sense of the word to breathe is to burn in a figurative sense man has long used the expression the torch of life but this figurative term proves to be the exact utterance of the truth air consumes the torch it consumes the animal no less it makes the torch give out heat and light and it produces in the animal heat and motion without air the torch goes out without air the animal dies from this point of view the animal may be compared to a highly perfected machine put in motion by heat it feeds and breathes to produce heat and motion it receives its fuel in the form of food and burns it in the inmost recesses of its body with the help of the air introduced by breathing that explains why the need of food is greater in winter than in summer the body cooling off more rapidly by contact with the outside cold air and consequently an increased consumption of fuel being required to maintain the normal temperature a low temperature creates a desire for food a high temperature lessens the demand to the hungry siberians hearty food is necessary they ask for bacon and other fats with brandy to drink but for the people of sahara a few dates suffice with a pinch of flour kneaded in the palm of the hand with a little water everything that lessens the loss of heat lessens also the need of food sleep rest warm clothing all serve to some extent as substitutes for food and so there is much truth in the saying that he who sleeps dines that may be jules assented but i dont see how hedgehogs and bats can do without food for four or five months at a time no matter how soundly i might sleep i couldnt go without eating so long as that wait until i finish and for the present remember this in every animal life depends on an actual and neverceasing combustion air as necessary to this combustion as to the burning of wood or coal in our stoves and fireplaces is taken into the body by breathing that is what makes breathing so urgent so incessant as to the fuel burned that is furnished by the substance of the animal itself by the blood made from digested food not a finger is lifted by us not a muscle moved that does not use up just so much of the fuel furnished by the blood which itself is made by the food we eat walking running working excitement all forms of exercise or emotionthese literally burn up our blood just as a locomotive burns its coal in dragging behind it the immense weight of a train that is why activity hard work increases our need for food while rest idleness lessens it i will now put to you a question let us suppose that there are on the hearth some burning brands but that they are few and small and you wish to keep the fire as long as possible would you let these firebrands burn freely would you take the bellows and blow air on them to increase the blaze no replied jules that would be just the way to burn up the brands in no time they must be covered with ashes if the air comes to them very slowly and only a little at a time they will burn gradually and the next morning we shall find the coals still alive that is well said my boy to keep up a fire for a long time with a given amount of fuel the draft must be reduced the access of air must be largely cut off but not intercepted altogether because then the fire would be completely extinguished therefore the live coals are buried under ashes and if the fire is in a stove the door of the ashpit is nearly closed with plenty of air combustion is active but of short duration with only a little air it is feeble but lasts a long time as the maintenance of life is the result of a real combustion any animal obliged to endure a long fast or in other words to dispense with the regular renewal of the fuel needed in that combustion must take into its body as little air as possible it must reduce the draft of its furnace this draft is respiration breathing and so in order to go without food for months at a time and to make the small amount of fuel held in reserve in the veins last as long as possible the animal has but one course to follow it must breathe as little as it can without depriving itself entirely of air for that would mean the total extinction of the vital spark just as the complete cutting off of air from a lighted lamp means the speedy extinction of its flame there you have the hedgehogs and the bats secret for enduring their long fast through the winter season first of all every precaution is taken to avoid all loss all unnecessary expenditure of heat and to economize as much as possible the reserves of fuel in their poor little veins the hedgehog wraps itself up warm in a thick blanket of leaves in the heart of a stoneheap or in some hollow tree trunk while the bats collect in compact groups in the warm shelter of a deep cave but that is not enough they must keep quite still as every movement uses up a certain amount of heat this requirement is scrupulously observed their immobility is such that you would say they were dead and yet all this is still insufficient respiration must be reduced to a minimum in fact their breathing is so weak that the closest scrutiny can hardly detect that they breathe at all this faint remnant of life is not to be compared you can well see to the blazing torch or the brightly burning fire both of which enjoying free combustion send out waves of heat and light it is rather the feeble glimmer of a night lamp husbanding its last drop of oil it is the coal that glows faintly under the ashes so profound is the torpor so nearly complete the inanition that were it not followed by an awakening this state would hardly differ in any respect from death the name hibernation is given to this temporary suspension of vitality or rather this slowing up of life to which certain animals are subject during the winter in the number of hibernating animals or animals that indulge in this long winter sleep are to be included besides the hedgehog and the bat the marmot the dormouse the lizard serpents of various kinds frogs and other reptiles do you need to be told that in order to assume and maintain this torpid condition in which for whole months food is unnecessary a special organization is required not every creature can hold its breath at will and thus escape the necessity of eating the dog and the cat might sleep ever so deeply yet as their breathing would go on almost as actively as in their waking hours hunger would arouse them before long just as it would me said emile no animals that have an assured supply of food for the winter hibernate but those that would otherwise perish with hunger in cold weather are saved from destruction by the providential torpor that overtakes them at the approach of the winter season their food supply being cut off they go to sleep the marmot is wrapped in slumber while the turf on the high mountains is covered with snow the dormouse when there is no longer any fruit frogs toads snakes lizards bats and hedgehogs as soon as there cease to be any more insects to feed upon the mole uncle paul had just trapped a mole that for some days had been uprooting young vegetables and unearthing newly planted seeds in a corner of the garden he called the childrens attention to the animals black coat softer than the finest velvet showed them its snout and made them note its peculiar fitness for digging pointed to its fore paws shaped like wide shovels for moving the earth with astonishing rapidity and remarked on its eyes so small as to be wellnigh useless and its jaws armed with savagelooking teeth it is a great pity said he that we are prejudiced against the mole on account of its habit of mining for there is not in all the world a more pitiless destroyer of vermin i had always heard louis remarked and had believed until now that moles lived on a vegetable diet chiefly of roots and that they tunneled under the ground to get them to forewarn you of the errors so widely current on the subject of the diet of certain animals i described to you in some detail the formation of teeth which always indicate the kind of food eaten i showed you that one has only to examine an animals teeth in order to determine whether it is carnivorous or herbivorous remember the adage that summed up our talks on the subject show me its teeth and i will tell you what the animal eats the mole is a good illustration it has fortyfour sharply pointed teeth not including the incisors do they look like millstones for the leisurely grinding of grain and roots or sharp tools for making mincemeat of torn flesh they are certainly the teeth of an animal that lives on prey louis admitted the hedgehog and the bat havent sharper ones to make you sure of this fact uncle paul went on i will tell you about some experiments made on the diet of moles we owe them to a learned french naturalist flourens if after you are grown up you ever have a chance to read his remarkable works you will find them very interesting and valuable flourens put two live moles into a cask and believing them to be herbivorous gave them for food a supply of roots carrots and turnips as you see the illustrious naturalist shared the accepted opinion the false notion just repeated by louis but flourens was soon undeceived the next morning the vegetables were found untouched while one of the moles had been devoured by its companion and there was nothing left of it but the skin turned inside out one of the moles had eaten the other cried emile oh what a fierce creature it had feasted on its own kind a thing that hardly any other animal does in devouring its comrade it had in the course of the night eaten its own weight of food and yet the next morning it seemed restless and very hungry flourens threw it a live sparrow whose wings he had just clipped the mole smelt it walked around it received a few hard pecks from its beak then pouncing on the bird tore its stomach open and enlarged the opening with its claws so as to plunge its head into the midst of the entrails with its pointed snout the horrible creature bored into them with frantic delight in less than no time it had devoured half the contents of the skin which with its feathers was left whole flourens then lowered into the cask a glass full of water and saw the mole stand up against the glass cling to the edge with its fore claws and drink eagerly when it had had enough the animal returned to the sparrow ate a little more of it and finally completely full lay down to sleep in a corner the glass and the remains of the bird were then taken out of the cask hardly six hours later the mole hungry again began to smell around the bottom of the cask in search of something to eat a second sparrow was thrown to it the mole immediately tore open the stomach to get at its entrails when it had eaten most of the bird and taken another big drink of water it appeared satisfied and remained quiet this was its last meal for the day just think boys what a quantity of reeking flesh it took to satisfy one moles hunger in the night its companion in captivity and the next day two sparrows the weight of the food eaten in twentyfour hours was nearly twice that of the eater was the animal satisfied for long by no means the next morning the mole was wandering restlessly about in the bottom of its cask apparently wild with hunger food quick quick or it will die of starvation the remains of the sparrow left over from the evening before with a frog which it promptly disemboweled quieted it for a while finally a toad was thrown to it as soon as the mole approached to rip it up the toad inflated its body hoping perhaps to frighten the enemy with its repulsive appearance at any rate it succeeded after sniffing at it the mole turned away in disgust ah you dont want the toad you greedy creature then you shall have turnips cabbages and carrots plenty of these were given it but fie on roots rather perish than eat turnips the next morning the mole was found to have starved to death amid the vegetables it had scorned to touch them with so much as a tooth had this animal an exceptional appetite a taste for unusual things that it should have preferred to die of hunger rather than touch vegetable food not at all it merely followed the preferences of all its kind many other experiments have been performed both by flourens and by other observers all the moles they have tried to feed with vegetable substanceswith bread lettuce cabbages roots herbage of any descriptionhave starved to death without touching their provisions on the other hand those that were fed with raw flesh worms larvæ and insects of various kinds remained alive another very simple way to determine positively the kind of food eaten by this animal is to examine the contents of its stomach as it lives in the freedom of its customary haunts everything eaten by it must find its way to the stomach let us catch a mole cut it open and investigate the stomach is found to contain sometimes red pieces of common earthworms or it may be a pap of beetles recognizable from the scaly remains that have not been digested or still again and rather oftener we find a marmalade of larvæ especially the larvæ of junebugsundigested bits of mandibles and the hard shell of the skull in short one is likely to come upon a mixed hash of all the small creatures inhabiting the soil such as woodlice millipeds cutworms moths in the chrysalis state caterpillars and subterranean nymphs but no matter how carefully we search we cannot find a bit of vegetable matter all possible observation points to the same conclusion despite what is believed by so many it is certain that the moles diet is confined to animal substances and could it i ask you be otherwise would the stomachs contents belie the savage set of teeth you have just seen in the picture do not its teeth show that it is a flesheater yes the mole eats flesh and nothing else everything proves this besides remember its big appetite if one may call appetite the raging demands of a stomach that in twelve hours requires a quantity of food equal to the weight of the animal the moles existence is a gluttonous frenzy this frenzy seizes the creature three or four times a day and it dies of starvation if it has to go without food for more than a few hours to satisfy its appetite when its food melts away and disappears almost as soon as swallowed what can the mole count on live sparrows which it devoured with such zest in the experiments of flourens are evidently not for a hunter that burrows underground at most some stray frog found in the field may fall into its clutches what then is left for it to count on the larvæ buried underground and especially those of the junebug tender and fat as bacon that is very little i admit for such hunger but the number to be had will make up for the smallness of the prey what a slaughter of white worms must take place when the soil abounds in this small game scarcely is one meal finished when another begins and each time no doubt other small insects are eaten by the dozen to free a field of these destroyers of our crops there is no helper equal to the mole a valued destroyer of verminthat is what we defend when we take the moles part and give to it even if somewhat reluctantly the honorable title of helper that title in truth it only partly deserves to catch the crickets the larvæ the white worms and the insects of all kinds that it feeds on the mole is obliged to disturb the roots amid which its prey is to be found many that interfere with it in its work are cut plants have their roots laid bare and are even uprooted altogether and finally the earth dug up by this untiring miner is piled on the surface in little mounds or molehills with such upturning of the soil a field of vegetables may be speedily ruined and a crop of grain badly damaged one night is enough for a mole to undermine a large tract for the famished creature is singularly quick in boring the soil where it hopes to find something to eat it is well equipped for making its underground galleries which often are hundreds of meters long the body is stubby and almost cylindrical from one end to the other so as to slip with the least resistance through the narrow passages bored by the animal the fur is short thick and carefully curried so that it shall not catch the dust and may be kept perfectly clean even in the most dusty soil the tail is very short and the external ears are wanting although the hearing is remarkably acute ears like those of animals that live in the open would be in the way underground in the mole they are made very tiny for the animals greater convenience no luxurious outfit does it ask for but only what is strictly necessary for its work of mining eyes wide open so that the dirt could get into them would be a perpetual torment to the creature and besides what use could it make of them in the total darkness of its abode the mole is not exactly blind as is generally believed it has two eyes but these are very small and set so deep in the surrounding fur that they can be of little use it is guided by the sense of smell in which it rivals the pig and like the pig it has a snout of the right shape for digging up a toothsome morsel with its snout the pig finds and roots out the savory titbit buried in the ground the mole in like manner discovers and digs up the plump white worm to reach it amid a network of roots and under a considerable thickness of soil the animal has its fore paws which spread out like large strong hands with exceptionally tough nails these handsstout shovels which if need be can open a passage through tufa a soft sort of rockare the moles principal tools as the animal advances digging with its snout and clearing away with its hands the earth is thrown to the rear by its hind feet which are much weaker than the hands but strong enough for the far lighter task if the mole proposes to return by the same road the track must be kept clear accordingly the earth dug up is thrown outside to form molehills at intervals for the present these details will suffice now let us take up the muchdiscussed question of the moles usefulness should we considering the undoubted services it renders us let it live in our fields or ought we rather on account of its destructive digging to look upon it as an enemy and wage war on it most people seem to feel we should make war on itwar to the death some persons make it a practice to destroy every mole they find and there is small pity bestowed upon the little creature unearthed by the spade but i should like to remind the moles pitiless enemies that insects do far worse damage and that for ridding a field of insects nothing is equal to this bloodthirsty hunter notwithstanding all opinion to the contrary i believe that moles in moderate numbers are needed in a field that it is unwise to destroy them all indeed experience has proved this i know of regions where the moles have been hunted down and destroyed until not one was left now do you know what was the result the white worms multiplied so that they ate up everything in the fields to get rid of the worms it was necessary to let the moles come back and to let them stay so long as they did not become too numerous and there is something else to be said for the mole molehills are formed of wellworked earth which when spread about with the rake is very good for young grass further the creatures subterranean galleries serve as drains for keeping the soil in a sanitary condition letting off the extra water just as regular drains would do on the whole then after weighing the arguments on both sides i am of the opinion that the mole ought not to be banished from our fields unless it multiplies to excess and how about gardens queried louis that is another question in a few hours a mole can almost ruin a garden who would want such a digger among his growing vegetables you carefully sow your seeds set out your young plants even off the ground and make waterchannels the very next morningplague take the creature it has turned everything topsyturvy quick a spade a trap and let us get rid of the pest as soon as possible suppose however that cutworms and other destructive vermin abound shall we gain anything by killing the mole certainly not the insects will speedily do more harm than the mole has just wrought greater mischief is in store and that is all there is about it if i had a garden infested with destructive insects here is what i should do in the spring i should let loose in my garden half a dozen moles taken alive in the field and i should then leave them to pursue their hunting in peace their work done the ground cleaned i should take the moles away you can catch them whenever you want to asked louis nothing easier you shall see for yourself the moles nestthe shrewmouse all that you know of the moles labors is confined to the little mounds of earth the molehills that it throws up and the tunnels of greater or less extent that it bores just beneath the surface of the soil these tunnels are huntingtrails made by the animal in order to search amid the roots for the larvæ it lives on if the ground is full of game the mole halts there probing to right and left wherever it smells a grub if the spot is a poor one it prolongs the tunnel or bores fresh ones hither and thither in every direction until it finds a place to suit it but however abundant the larvæ may be one vein is soon exhausted whereupon the old diggings are abandoned and fresh ones undertaken from day to day near its huntingground thus honeycombed with a succession of tunnels as called for the mole has a burrow a fixed abode to which it retires to rest sleep and rear its young this burrow is a work of art a strong castle in the making of which the cautious animal uses great skill with a view to the utmost possible security you must not think i am talking about the molehills which are merely the dirt thrown out in the digging the mole is never to be found lurking beneath these crumbling hillocks its dwelling is something quite different it is underground at a depth of nearly a meter usually beneath a hedge or at the foot of a wall or amid the big roots of some great tree this natural shelter makes it strong so that it will not cave in its main part is a chamber c shaped somewhat like an inverted bottle carefully roughcoated with loam and made smooth on the inside it is furnished with a warm bed of moss and dry grass that is the moles restingplace its bedroom the family nest two circular tunnels run around it at a distance the lower one a larger the upper one b of lesser diameter they serve as sentryposts for the safeguarding of the main chamber stationed in the upper tunnel which is reached by three passages leading from the large chamber the mole listens to what is going on outside if some danger threatens half a dozen exits are provided for speedy descent to the lower tunnel whence there are numerous outlets for instant flight these lead in all directions but soon bend back and into the main passage p if danger overtakes the mole in its inmost retreat c it escapes by the tunnel h which leads out from below winds around and rejoins the main passage p i get lost in all those tunnels and passages said emile the moles house is very complicated for us perhaps but not for the mole it knows every twist and turn of these winding tunnels and can get away at very short notice you think you can catch it in its home but in a twinkling it is gone and you dont know in what direction the passages for flight both those that go in all directions from the lower circular tunnel and those that run straight from the chamber all lead finally into the passage marked p the entranceway to the moles abode and this passage is the main one between the large chamber and the huntingground the permanent highway over which the mole passes to and fro three or four times a dayin fact every time it goes on an expedition or returns home this passage meant to last as long as the dwelling remains in use is much more carefully made than the simple burrows bored from day to day as the mole seeks its food it is deeper down wider smooth and well beaten no molehill is over it its covering of earth is solid yet something betrays it to the searchers eye on account of the moles incessant comings and goings the roots of any plants growing there are more injured than are those over the ordinary tunnels made by the animal consequently the grass has an unhealthy yellowish look once this passage is knownand the strip of yellow grass points it outthe mole can be caught at any time a trap is set inside the tunnel obliged to pass through either to get out or to come in the mole cannot fail to be taken sooner or later that is plain enough said louis i see now how easy it would be to catch moles again whenever you want to after they have been let loose in a garden to rid it of insects to conclude my account of insectivorous animals uncle paul went on i will now tell you about the very smallest of mammals a tiny creature not more than two inches long this cunning little animal looks somewhat like a mouse but is much smaller the tail is shorter the head more tapering and the nose ends in a sharper point the ears are short and rounded but the coat is almost the same as that of the mouse the shrewmouse has the same tastes as the mole it is an ardent hunter of small game a devourer of larvæ and insects as you can see by its finely serrate teeth its slender body made for squeezing into the smallest hole and its long snout shaped for prying into the narrowest crannies and crevices enable it to go wherever vermin may be lurking woe to the woodlouse rolled up like a tiny pellet in some crack in the wall and to the slug hiding under a stone the shrewmouse will have no difficulty in catching them being so small that it could make its home in a nutshell it will not help them to hide for the shrewmouse does not need to see them in order to find them it detects them by its subtle sense of smell and hears them if they make the slightest movement the burrows of the beetles the warrens of the larvæ the lurkingplaces of the tiniest worms hold no secrets from the shrewmouse it might be appropriately called the insects ferret these little creatures are to be found in fields and meadows and gardens and in winter they come near our houses and make their nests under strawstacks and dungheaps in very cold weather they even find their way into stables where they live on cockroaches and woodlice but at the approach of summer they are off again to the open fields where they complete the moles work of extermination or they may seek some garden where they protect the wallfruit and the vegetable patches from the devouring insect hordes without ever touching any of the growing crops themselves the teeth of the shrewmouse are not made for the chewing of vegetable food like the mole this tiny creature is carnivorous moreover in their huntingraids which are so greatly to our advantage shrewmice never do us the slightest injury of any sort as they never bore tunnels but merely use the natural cracks in the soil they cannot be reproached with severing roots or throwing up mounds of earth as moles do and yet they are perhaps more an object of general execration than the latter it is considered a praiseworthy act to crush them every time one gets a chance how has so tiny pleasing and useful a creature managed thus to incur the hatred of man we have here my children another instance of the foolish way we accept the first notion that enters our heads without trying to test it by observation and reason it is said that the shrewmouse bites horses feet and leaves incurable wounds but how can a shrewmouse whose head is at most no larger than a pea bite a horse and pierce its hide which is the thickness of a finger or more again they say the shrewmouse is venomous even for man some time ago children i told you about the viper 2 you know what its weapons aretwo long sharp teeth or fangs having little channels through which it introduces a drop of venom into the wound it inflicts well i assure you the shrewmouse has no weapon like the vipers it has neither fangs nor a poisonsac but is wholly harmless to man and horse insects alone need fear its fine teethnot that they are poisoned in any way but because they crunch their little victims very neatly i think i see why the shrewmouse has incurred the charge of being venomous the pretty little creature exhales an odor it smells rather strongly of musk the cat taking it for a mouse sometimes chases it but repelled by its odor never eats it the first to observe this fact said to himself as the cat does not dare eat it the shrewmouse must be venomous ever since then this false belief has passed for truth in the country and no one has taken the trouble to look into the matter more closely so that the poor little shrewmouse one of our most useful and harmless helpers falls a victim to the stupidity of man whose gardens it protects the exploit of oneeyed john it happened one day that oneeyed john caught an owl in his corncrib and he had just nailed the live bird to his house door as a bandit of the worst kind worthy to be exposed to the jeers of all who passed and to dry up on the spot so as to serve as a scarecrow john was very proud of his deed he laughed at the clickclacking of the birds beak at the desperate rolling of the eyes as the owl hung there crucified its grimaces and contortions the convulsive efforts of the wings to free themselves from the big nails that pierced them and the fits of impotent rage expressed by the spasmodic working of the talons put him in the best of humors the children of the neighborhood cruel and heartless as is usual at their age and still more cruel when grown persons set the sad example had gathered before the door and were joining in the laugh at the owls sufferings john told them that his neighbor old annette had died two weeks before because the owl came three times in quick succession and hooted on the roof of the house those creatures said he are badluck birds at night they fly into churches and drink the oil out of the lamps they perch on the roofs of sick peoples houses and foretell their death and they snuggle into a hole in the belfry and laugh when the bell tolls for a funeral all this of course frightened the children see said the youngest pressing close to his brother how the owl threatens us with its big red eyes it must be awfully wicked its so ugly said another lets hurt it that will teach it to laugh when people die and to drink oil out of the holy lamps john put its eyes out with this pointed stick it looks at us so wickedly and put this piece of glass in its claws so that it will cut its fingers and thus each one did what he could to harm the helpless creature each tried to invent some new torture for it just then louis happened to come along and the children called to him to join them in tormenting the owl more merciful than his comrades especially since he had fallen into the way of visiting uncle pauls house louis turned his eyes away from this frightful spectacle and begged john to end the birds agony instead of making it suffer still further tortures but the boys entreaties were all in vain and he went away much distressed as he was going home he recalled something uncle paul had said in one of his talks he had told the boys that when the ignorant crowd agrees to call a thing black it is always well to see whether after all the thing may not be white here is oneeyed john said louis to himself oneeyed john known all about here for his ignorance he has never in his life opened a book and he glories in the fact he cant sign his name and he rejects with mulish obstinacy every wise suggestion at this very moment he is urging on the children against that poor owl he has just nailed to his door and to make them think there is some reason why he should be so cruel he tells them it is a graveyard bird a badluck bird that brings misfortune to people according to his account the owl is an evil creature full of malice and deserves no pity we must punish it for its wickedness make it suffer torments as an example to others of its kind and put it to death without mercy but what if just the opposite of all this should be true what if the owl were really a harmless creature or even a very useful one and worthy of our protection i must find out accordingly that evening at uncle pauls this was the first thing he asked about at louiss description of the tortured owl uncle paul at once recognized its species the bird that john thought he must nail alive to his door said he is the belfryowl also called the barnowl the unfortunate creature in no way deserved the frightful treatment it received i pity it for having fallen into hands made cruel by ignorance stupidity and malice go together they say and it is very true he who is ignorant is deliberately cruel wild and foolish things are said against the barnowl and john repeated them having heard them from some one else he now in his turn passes them on to the street urchins who were so eager to put out the birds eyes it is not true that the barnowl flies into churches and drinks the oil from the lamp that is kept lighted night and day in the sanctuary it is not true that it laughs when it hears the passingbell it is not true that its hooting on the roof of a house means that some one in the house will soon die false are all the sayings about its evil influence and its predictions of misfortune and any one who believes these absurd stories simply shows that he has no common sense we are in gods hands my children and god alone knows when our last hour is to come let us pity those feebleminded persons who believe the owl knows this tremendous secret let us pity them but never let us abuse our reasoning powers by believing that an owl in expressing after its own fashion on some houseroof its satisfaction at having caught a mouse is solemnly foretelling what is going to happen uncle pauls nephews must henceforth pay not the slightest attention to any such superstitious notions let us go on what would you say of john if he had taken it into his head to kill his cat by nailing the animal to the door by its fore paws i should say answered louis that if rats ever ate him up it would serve him right what you saw him doing amounts to about the same thing he was torturing one of the very best destroyers of mice a bird in form a cat in habits the barnowl went into the corncrib to guard the poor mans wheat from rats and john a prey to superstitious hatred and never thinking of the service the owl was doing him made haste to nail the useful bird to his door what strange wrongheadedness is it that makes us all as a rule destroy the animals that help us most almost all our helpers are persecuted their good will must be very strong else our ill treatment would long ago have driven them forever from our dwellings and fields bats rid us of a host of enemies but none the less we look upon them with dislike the mole and the shrewmouse purge the soil of vermin and we dislike them too the hedgehog makes war on vipers and white worms and we make war on him the owl and various other nightbirds are fine rathunters but that does not save them from mistreatment still other animals that i will tell you about later do the most useful work for us and we persecute them all they are ugly people say and for no other reason they are killed but blind slayers shall you not at last have your eyes opened to the fact that because of an unreasonable dislike you have sacrificed your own defenders you complain of ratsand you nail the owl to your door where you let its carcass dry up a hideous trophy you complain of the white wormsand you crush the mole every time the spade brings one to light you rip up the hedgehog and set your dogs on him just for fun you complain of the ravages of moths in your granaries and if a bat falls into your hands you seldom spare it you complain and yet you mistreat all the animals that offer to help you blind you are and sadly misguided in your wanton cruelty regarded merely as it affects his own interests it is a pitiful piece of work that john has done but it is far more pitiful in respect to the tortures he has inflicted on the bird it is not the mark of a man but of a brute to take pleasure in torturing an animal it is a wicked act and one that good men despise ignorance is the cause of the act but ignorance is not an excuse if an animal is harmful to us let us get rid of it by killing it but let us never think of inflicting needless pain of causing suffering simply for sufferings sake that would be to smother in ourselves one of the noblest of sentiments compassion it would mean the arousing of savage instincts which too often lead to crime he who finds his pleasure in torturing dumb animals cannot take pity on the suffering of his own kind his heart is hardened and prone to evil how i pity those poor children who stood by and laughed at the barnowls horrible sufferings and who led on by the mans example helped to put out the wretched birds eyes how i pity them let them beware let their parents take heed for there is a bad streak in them nocturnal birds of prey the barnowl the horned owl the gray owl the white owl and other similar birds are known under the general name of nocturnal birds of prey they are called birds of prey because they live by hunting game of various sorts especially such rodents as rats and mice they are among birds what the cat is among mammals untiring destroyers of those furcovered creatures of which the mouse is the most familiar example to you our language has long since taken note of this resemblance in habits by coining the name chathuant hooting cat which is applied to some of these birds they are cats that fly that hoot or in other words that utter cries like mournful howls of distress also they are nocturnal that is they remain during the day in some obscure hidingplace which they leave only at nightfall to hunt in the twilight and moonlight their eyes are very large and round and are placed in the front of the head instead of one on each side a wide ring of fine feathers encircles each eye the need for these enormous eyes is plainly seen in the birds nocturnal habits being obliged to seek their food in a very feeble light they must in order to see with any distinctness have eyes that admit as much light as possible that is the eyes must be such as can open wide but this development of the organs of sight so useful in the nighttime is a serious inconvenience in the bright light of day dazzled blinded by the suns rays the bird of darkness stays in some safe hole and dares not come out if obliged to issue forth it does so with extreme caution for fear of hurting itself it wings its way with hesitation and in short slow flights other birds birds of the day seeing its uncertainty and awkwardness come and vie with one another in offering insults to the clumsy stranger the redbreast and the tomtit are among the first to hasten to the scene followed by the finch the blackbird the jay the thrush and many others perched on a branch the nightbird receives the aggressors with a grotesque balancing of its body turning its big head this way and that in a ridiculous manner and rolling its great eyes as if thinking thus to terrify its persecutors but all in vain the smallest and weakest are the boldest in tormenting it they assault their victim with beak and claw pulling out its feathers before the hapless bird can muster courage to defend itself just think said emile of a teasing tomtit and a saucy redbreast making sport of an owl blinded by the sun why do they behave so from motives of revenge the owl loses no opportunity to gobble up those little birds in the night and shows no more compunction over it than if they were nothing but common mice therefore what a frolic it is for the little winged people when by good luck the nightbird strays into the light of day the pecks fall thick as hail on the sufferers back and it is nearly deafened with shrill screams of triumph and insulting cries of hatred the redbreast pulls out a feather the tomtit threatens the enemys eyes the jay overwhelms it with abuse the whole grove is in an uproar but beware when night closes in then the boldest will lose courage these same saucy little birds that come in the daytime and insult the owl flee from it in wild alarm as soon as darkness allows it to move about and use its powerful talons and hooked beak the redbreast had better get out of the owls way when the owl can see said emile it would pay dearly if it tried then to pull out a feather on account of the great size of their eyes nocturnal birds of prey require a soft light like that of dawn and nightfall consequently they leave their lurkingplaces to hunt for prey either soon after sunset or just before dawn then it is that their raids are most likely to be successful for they find the small animals either fast asleep or on the point of falling asleep moonlight nights are the best for their purposes those are their nights of veritable joy and feasting when they can hunt for hours at a time and lay in large supplies of choice provisions but when there is no moon they have only one scant hour in the early morning and another in the evening for hunting that means they must fast for hours and that is why they are so greedy when they can get as much food as they want they are very silly to fast like that emile declared in their place i should hunt all night even without a moon you say that because you think the owl can see clearly in the blackest darkness but you are mistaken to see we must not merely direct our gaze toward the object to be seen we must receive into our eyes the light reflected from that object in the act of seeing nothing goes out from us everything comes to us from the thing seen we do not really throw our glance toward any given object it is the object that throws its light toward us or if it does not throw any light it is for that reason invisible what i am now saying about human beings applies to all animals not one absolutely not one can see in the absence of light i had always thought said louis that cats could see in pitchdarkness others think so too but they are much mistaken the cat can no more distinguish objects if light is totally lacking than any other creature can it has an advantage over us i grant you it has large eyes the pupils of which it can contract and almost close when it finds itself exposed to a bright light that would otherwise dazzle it or open wide to receive more of the feeble light diffused in a dark room these large eyes enable it to find its way in places which to us with our poorer sight seem pitchdark but in reality the darkness is not complete where a cat can manage to see well enough for its purposes if light is totally lacking the cat may open its eyes as wide as possible but it will see nothing absolutely nothing in this particular nocturnal birds do not differ from the cat their large eyes made for seeing in a dim light can see nothing whatever when the night is perfectly dark now let us follow the bird in its hunt the night is a fine one for hunting the air is calm the moon shining the hunt begins with a lugubrious warcry at that dreaded signal the tomtit hardly feels safe even in the deepest hollow of its tree the redbreast trembles beneath its shelter of thick foliage and the finch loses its head with fright god of the weak god of the little birds protect them now make the owl enraged as it still is from the insults of the day miss them in its search blessed be thy holy name if the rapacious bird turns in some other direction it skirts the groves and skims over the open plain and the plowed fields it inspects the furrows where the fieldmouse crouches the stretches of grassland where the mole burrows the tumbledown buildings in which rats and mice scamper to and fro its flight is silent its soft wings cleaving the air without making the slightest sound to awaken its intended victims this noiselessness of flight is due to the structure of the birds feathers which are soft as silk and of finest texture nothing gives warning of its sudden coming the prey is seized even before it has suspected the nearness of the enemy the owl on the contrary with its exceptional acuteness of hearing is kept informed of all that is going on in the neighborhood its large deep ears detecting even the rustle of a fieldmouse in the grass if the mouse begins to nibble a rootlet or a grain of wheat the bird hears the sound of its incisors and pounces on it immediately the prey is seized by two strong claws warmly gloved in down as far as the roots of the nails each foot has four toes three pointing habitually forward and one backward but by a privilege peculiar to nocturnal birds of prey one of the front toes is movable and can be turned back so that the set of talons is divided into two pairs of equal power whenever the bird wishes to grip as in a vise the branch on which it perches or the victim struggling in its grasp one blow of the beak breaks the head of the captured creature this beak is short and very hooked the two mandibles move with great ease which enables them in striking against each other to give out a sharp rattling sound or clicking by which the bird expresses anger or fright they stretch wide at the moment of swallowing exposing a big opening leading into a very large gullet when they are thus opened the prey which has already been kneaded into a compact mass between the claws disappears entirely as if swallowed up by an abyss all goes down including bones and hair not a trace is left of the fieldmouse not even its coat of fur but a single victim is seldom enough and so the hunt continues more mice follow the first one and all are first killed by a peck on the head all are swallowed whole if the bird chances upon a fat beetle he does not disdain it it is a small mouthful to be sure but highly flavored with spices that will aid digestion at last having eaten all it possibly can the owl returns to its lodging in the hollow of some rock or in a decayed tree trunk or in some ruined building now follows digestion motionless in the quiet of its peaceful solitude the bird gently closes its eyes to dream of the fine exploits it has just achieved and to plan others for the following night its slumbers are deep and long in the meantime the stomach does its work the food swallowed without any preparation or sorting must be divided into two parts that which is really nutritious and that which is worthless with the aid of its gastric juice the stomach carefully separates the bones and skins from the nutritious part of its contents the flesh thus made semifluid disappears to be converted into blood and a confused mass remains composed of skins turned inside out and wearing all their fur bones as clean as if they had been scraped with a knife and the hard wingcovers of beetles this bulky mass could not be passed on by the stomach without danger how then will the bird get rid of it let us watch and find out ah the owl is waking up grotesque heavings of the body denote trouble within the disturbance increases something ascends through the outstretched neck the beak opens and it is all over there drops to the ground a ball containing skins bones scales fur feathersin fact the entire mass of indigestible matter all nocturnal birds of prey practise this undignified method of freeing the stomach they throw up in a ball the rejected remnants of what they have swallowed whole if you ever find yourself near an owls retreat examine the ground beneath it the balls of little bones and hair will tell you from how many mice and other rodents of all kinds these birds deliver us i have seen some of those balls near a rock all white with birddung said louis some owl certainly lived there it was responsible for the dung and the balls of refuse that you saw rats let us return for a moment to the rodents the habitual prey of the nightbirds you do not know them all by any means but we ought not to pass them by for if some like the hare and the rabbit are useful to us still more are very destructive you remember those two pairs of incisors so long and sharp that i told you about when i described the rabbits teeth all rodents have similar incisors to keep them sharp and prevent them from overlapping too much by growing too long which would make it impossible for the animal to feed itself the rodent must wear them down by constant friction as fast as they grow consequently these terrible incisors have so to speak no rest they must always be nibbling something no matter what thus the harm they do us is much greater than you would suspect from the size of the animal how much actual food does a mouse need for one meal very little unquestionably a mouse is so small that a single nut will fill its stomach dont think however that one days ravages are confined to that one nut after the nut is eaten the animal will proceed perhaps to gnaw a hole in a bag reduce a piece of cloth to tatters chew up a book or drill a hole in a board simply and solely to whet its teeth and the damage caused by rats and mice in our dwellinghouses is matched by other damage caused by other rodents in the fields you must make the acquaintance of all these destroyers for my part jules confessed i shouldnt if i saw it know the fieldmouse that you told us about in your talk on nightbirds i know rats and mice such as we have in the house said emile but thats all and yet rejoined his uncle i very much doubt whether you have any real knowledge of the rat i will begin with it the common or black rat is more than twice the size of a mouse its coat is nearly black above and ashy gray underneath it lives in granaries thatched roofs and abandoned ruins if it fails to find a lodging to its taste it burrows a hole for itself it is not a native with us but is thought to have come from asia in the wake of the armies returning from the crusades today the common rat is seldom mentioned in our country another foreign rodent has come in the norway or brown rat which being larger than the common rat has waged war against it and almost wiped out the species we have not gained by the exchange quite the contrary the norway rat being a much more troublesome creature the true rat the black rat is rare now especially where the other abounds and that is why i doubt that any one of you is familiar with it what you call a rat is more than likely to be one of these norwegian invaders dont forget the colorblackand you will have no difficulty in recognizing the true rat the mouse is much more familiar to you it has been known from the earliest times all over the world need i describe this little rodent so well known for its liveliness its wily nature and its extreme timidity which makes it scuttle away to its hole at the slightest alarm we all know the mouse very well jules assured him the norway or brown rat also known as the sewerrat is the largest and most troublesome of all european rats it attains a length of nearly a foot without counting the tail which is scaly like the mouses and a little shorter than the body the largest and strongest norway rat can cope with a cat its presence in europe dates only from the middle of the eighteenth century and it seems to have been brought from india in the hold of ships which it commonly infests it has now spread all over the world its coat is reddish brown above and ashy gray underneath norway rats frequent storehouses cellars sewers slaughterhouses and dumping grounds everything is food to these filthy and audacious creatures and they even dare to attack a sleeping man in large towns they multiply so fast as to cause serious alarm the vicinity of the slaughterhouse of montfaucon in paris is so undermined with their innumerable burrows that the buildings there are in danger of collapsing to preserve them from this disaster it is necessary to protect their foundation against the attacks of the rodents by means of a deep enclosing belt of broken glass bottles what attracts them in such numbers to these places asked jules the abundance of food the dead bodies of slaughtered horses in one night if left in the slaughterhouse yards dead horses are devoured to the skeleton during severe frosts if the skin is not removed in time the norway rats get inside the body stay there and eat all the flesh so that when a thaw comes and the workmen begin to skin the animal they find inside the skin nothing but a host of rats swarming among the bare bones but dont the people there have any cats to protect them asked emile cats the norway rats would eat them alive my boy in no time they have something better howeverdogs both terriers and bulldogs that run the rats down in the sewers with astonishing cleverness and break their back with one bite the bulldogthats the kind of cat you need for such mice this hunt in the sewer moreover must be frequently repeated for norway rats multiply with frightful rapidity and if we were not careful the town would sooner or later be endangered the horrible creature strong in its numbers would devour all paris in december of the year 1849 two hundred and fifty thousand rats were destroyed in a few days as the result of a single hunt in the country the norway rat frequents the banks of foul streams it enters kitchens through sinkholes it gets into henhouses and rabbitwarrens by undermining the walls it haunts cellars and stables but rarely makes its way into high granaries doubtless because of its liking for filthy drainage and any kind of offal which can be found only on ground floors and in basements it pounces upon eggs and young fowls and even has the boldness to suck the blood of fullgrown poultry and rabbits when it cannot get animal food which is its first choice it will eat grain and vegetables of all kinds no sort of food is rejected by this filthy glutton to get rid of it you can hardly count on the cat for usually pussy is afraid to attack it nor are nightbirds strong enough to battle with it except the eagleowl which does not abound in any numbers the trap and poison are our only remaining means of overcoming this redoubtable foe the fieldmouse is a little larger than the ordinary mouse its coat which closely resembles that of the norway rat is reddish brown above and white underneath its eyes are large and prominent its ears nearly black and its feet white its tail which is very long like that of the common mouse is thinly covered with hair and is black toward the end the fieldmouse frequents woods hedges fields and gardens it cuts down the stalks of grain to get at the ears of which it nibbles a few kernels and wastefully scatters the rest in its quest for food it unearths newly planted seeds takes a taste of the young shoots that have just come up gnaws the bark of shrubs and feasts on growing vegetables its ravages are all the more serious because it lays up provisions against a time of need in storage chambers more than a foot underground beneath some tree trunk or rock it collects grain hazelnuts acorns almonds and chestnuts often going a considerable distance to get them one such storeroom is not enough it must have several for it has a way of foolishly forgetting where its treasure is buried in winter the fieldmouse ventures to approach our houses and makes its way into our cellars where fruit and vegetables are kept or it establishes itself in great numbers in our granaries the dwarf rat or harvestmouse is the smallest rodent of france it is a graceful creature smaller than the common mouse and of a yellowish tawny color which is brighter on the rump than elsewhere but the belly breast and throat are a beautiful white and the tail and feet a light yellow the ears which stand out but very little beyond the fur of the head are rounded and hairy and the eyes are prominent the dwarf rat lives exclusively in grainfields and feeds on grain after the harvest it takes refuge in the stacks of grain especially in oatstacks but is never bold enough to enter houses i am telling you about this pretty little rodent not so much because i begrudge it the few grains of oats it steals from us as because i wish to acquaint you with its nest other rats rear their young either in a hole in a rock or a wall or in a burrow dug for the purpose the harvestmouse however scorns these stifling quarters it must have an aërial nest like that built by birds so it brings together several wheatstalks as they stand in the field interlaces them with bits of straw and builds halfway up from the ground a nest as beautifully made as any birds this nest is spherical interwoven with leaves on the outside and padded with moss on the inside it has only one little side opening through which the rain cannot enter suspended at the height of several feet on the flexible support of the grain stalks it swings to and fro with the slightest wind how then asked emile does the little mouse manage to get in and out of its nest it climbs up one of the stalks being so small that this serves it perfectly as a ladder if i ever come across a harvestmouse i shant have the heart to do it any harm it may go on eating oats in its pretty little nest for all i care i shant try to stop it here concluded uncle paul i will end my account of the chief representatives of the rat family in these regions they are five in number the black rat the mouse the norway rat the fieldmouse and the harvestmouse meadowmice 3hamstersdormice another kind of rodent now calls for our attention it is the family of meadowmice commonly confounded with rats meadowmice are easily recognized by their short slightly hairy tail the meadowmouse is about as large as a common mouse its coat is of a yellowish hue mixed with gray above and dirty white underneath the tail is only onequarter as long as the body the eyes are large and prominent the ears rounded hairy and standing out but little from the fur the head is large and less pointed than that of the ordinary mouse in its rapid and abundant breeding the meadowmouse is one of the farmers chief foes it overruns grainfields especially cutting down the stalks to nibble the ears after harvest it attacks clover roots carrots potatoes and the products in general of our kitchengardens in winter it digs under the furrows to eat the seeds sown there if the soil is so frostbound as not to permit it to reach the buried seed it retires to the stacks of grain where it does great damage it never makes its way into our dwellings meadowmice appear to emigrate from one country to another in colonies when the country they have ravaged can no longer supply them with food at any rate from time to time once or twice in a decade they suddenly appear in countless droves that are a real scourge to the country visited the best destroyers of these creatures are nocturnal birds of prey as is proved by the presence of their skulls bones and skins in the balls that are thrown up by these birds after digestion some say diurnal birds of prey buzzards in particular are equally fond of them it is not at all uncommon to find in a buzzards crop as many as ten or more meadowmice the underground meadowmouse is much less common in france than the one just described from which it differs in its grayandblackish coat its somewhat smaller tail and its tiny eyes but the greatest difference is in its habits the firstmentioned lives in the fields especially in grainfields while the second frequents meadows and kitchengardens it feeds on various kinds of vegetables such as celery artichokes carrots potatoes and cardoons it seldom shows itself out of its underground tunnels and on account of its habit of lurking beneath the surface it is called the underground meadowmouse the amphibian meadowmouse is commonly known by the name of waterrat we can easily tell it from the black rat which is of about the same size by its red coat its short tail which is not quite half the length of its body and its larger and less pointed head it burrows under the banks of streams ditches and marshes where it feeds chiefly on roots but does not disdain small fish when it can catch them it is a good swimmer and diver sometimes it makes its way into kitchengardens where it does the same sort of harm as the underground meadowmouse and into orchards where it gnaws the base of young trees the lemming is never seen around here it frequents the coasts of the arctic ocean in norway and lapland i will tell you something about it on account of its curious way of traveling from one country to another of which our meadowmouse offers us a far less striking example the lemming with its very short and hairy tail its big head and its stocky body has the appearance of a small rabbit its coat is red marbled with black and brown at the approach of severe cold weather and sometimes with no apparent reason the lemmings leave their haunts in the high mountain chains of norway and set out on a long journey toward the sea the emigrating horde composed of myriads of individuals trot in a straight line over all obstacles never allowing themselves to be turned from their course in traveling in a line one after another says linnæus the great swedish naturalist they trace straight parallel furrows two or three fingers deep and several ells apart they devour everything eatable that obstructs their passage all roots and herbage nothing turns them from their course let a man appear in their path and they slip between his legs if they come to a haystack they gnaw a tunnel through it reaching a rock they skirt it in a semicircle and then resume their original direction should a lake be encountered on their route they swim across it in a straight line however wide it may be if a boat is in their way in the middle of a body of water they clamber over it and jump into the water again on the other side a swiftly flowing river does not stop them they plunge into the foaming current even if they all perish they must be very obstinate said emile to prefer to drown rather than turn their procession out of a straight line animals sometimes show these examples of obstinacy which we cannot understand but which might easily be explained if we knew the motives that make them act thus perhaps by deviating from a straight line the lemmings might lose their way a way provided with no fingerposts but indicated simply by instinct however we will leave them to pursue their long pilgrimage from which few will return so numerous are the dangers and the enemies awaiting them on the way let them cross their rivers and lakes while we return to the rodents of france the hamster abounds in central europe notably in alsace it is also called the strasbourg marmot or rye pig it is almost as large as the black rat but is more stocky its tail is short and hairy its fur red on the back black under the belly with yellowish spots on the flanks a white spot on the throat and another on each shoulder hamsters live on roots fruit and especially cereals of which they store up a large supply each animal digs a burrow composed of several rooms the largest of which is used as a granary there they store rye and wheat beans and peas vetch and linseed the hamster hoards like a miser laying up far more than it will ever need simply for the satisfaction of hoarding in some of its storerooms as much as two hundredweight of provisions may be found what can a creature no bigger than your fist do with all these supplies winter comes and the hamster shuts itself up in its underground quarters assured of food and lodging and grows big and fat if the cold is very severe it goes to sleep like the marmot and what about the two hundredweight of grain collected a kernel at a time queried emile the whole supply simply spoils and is so much waste but little does the hamster care he begins all over again the next year the animals special business is first and foremost to ravage fields as is proved by the pile of grain it stores up out of all proportion to its needs it hoards food to destroy it far more than to be sure of something to eat being very different in this way from most hibernating animals in the midst of all its stores of food if the winter is very cold it is overtaken by the same torpor that saves the hedgehog and the bat from death by starvation this miser has not even the excuse of want happy are those regions that it does not rob let us pass on to other rodents there are then still more of these greedy animals jules inquired yes they are somewhat like insects after they are all gone there are still some left the world seems to be a pasture delivered over to the mandibles of larvæ and the incisors of rodents dormice of many varieties live in the woods and orchards and eat fruit these rodents have the agility elegance of form and rich fur of squirrels they make their home in hollow tree trunks holes in walls and crannies in rocks during the winter when fruit is lacking they remain in a deep sleep the dormouse proper is found in provence and roussillon it is a pretty creature reminding one of the squirrel its tail is long and thickly covered with hair its fur ashy brown on the back and whitish under the belly at night it ravages the fruittrees and no one knows better how to pick out the pear the peach or the plum at just the right stage of ripeness you have let us suppose looked over your fruit with satisfaction and decided to give it one more day of sunshine to bring it to perfection the next morning you go out to gather the harvest and lo and behold it is gone the dormouse has been there before you the garden dormouse is smaller being about as large as the black rat its coat is a pleasing mixture of red white and black the back being red the belly paws cheeks and shoulders white and the parts about the eyes and down the sides of the neck black this animal is scattered all over france it lurks about dwellings in gardens and among vines and shrubbery living chiefly on fruit which it ruins in great quantities tasting first one choice specimen and then another without finishing any of them garden dormice spend the winter several in one hole where they sleep all curled up amid the supplies of walnuts almonds and hazelnuts that they have laid up then if they sleep said emile they dont need any food pardon me my boy they do need food and badly though not while sleeping but when they wake up this awakening takes place at the beginning of spring when the sun is first warming up the earth at that time of year there is no fruit to be had and the garden dormice after their fast of several months have a tremendous appetite as you can easily imagine what would become of them now poor little things if it were not for their supply of nuts those little dormice are very prudent emile remarked they know that at the end of their long winters sleep they wont find any fruit in the orchards and so they lay up provisions beforehand but why dont they put by apples and pears if they are so fond of them because apples and pears would spoil whereas almonds and hazelnuts keep very well thats so i hadnt thought of that but the little dormouse had no it does not think of it either it does not know that pears spoil and nuts keep because it has never tried to keep pears it does not foresee that when it wakes up the fruittrees will not be bearing fruit will hardly have their first leaves it does not know how long it would have to wait to find a pear to nibble it knows nothing of all these things which it is now about to become aware of perhaps for the first time through experience some one else thinks for the dormouse and gives it the prudence to store up nuts in a hole in the wall some one who understands foresees and knows everything and that some one is god the father of the man who plants the peartree and father also of the little dormouse that is so fond of pears horned owls we have glanced in a cursory way at a number of our rodents that are harmful to crops i pass over in silence the pretty squirrel a lover of walnuts and beechnuts and the industrious beaver an animal which may still be found here and there along the rhone the hare and the rabbit too i willingly give over to the hunters rifle what protection have we from the devouring hunger of the othersthe rats the fieldmice and the meadowmice how are we to hold them in check in our homes we have the cat outside we have the army of feathered catsthe nocturnal birds of prey i will divide these latter into two classes to make it easier to distinguish the various species one has the head adorned with two tufts of feathersplumicorns is the term sometimes usedwhile the other class lacks this ornament horned owls come under the first classification hornless owls or those that may be called simply owls come under the second the largest of the horned owls is the eagleowl it can easily be recognized says buffon by its burly form its enormous head its large and cavernous ears the two egrets surmounting its head to a height of more than two inches and a half its short hooked beak black in color its great clear eyes with their fixed gaze and large black pupils encircled by an orangecolored ruff of feathers and its face surrounded by hairsor rather little rudimentary white feathers bordering a ring of other little feathers that are curledalso by its black hooked claws of great strength its very short neck its reddish brown plumage spotted with black and yellow on the back its feet covered with thick down and reddish feathers to the very roots of the nails and finally its hairraising cry of wheehoo hoohoo hoohoo poohoo which it sends forth in the silence of the night when all the rest of the world is still then it is that it awakens its intended victims fills them with vague alarm pursues and catches them and carries them off to the caverns where it has its hidingplace it lives among the rocks or in old deserted towers in the mountains rarely descending into the plains and never willingly perching on trees but rather on the roof of some sequestered church or ancient castle its favorite prey consists of young hares little rabbits fieldmice and rats of which it digests the fleshy substance and throws up the hair bones and skin in round balls the eagleowl makes its nest in some rocky cave or in a hole in some lofty old wall its nest is nearly three feet in diameter and is made of small dry branches interwoven with flexible roots and padded with leaves inside only one or two or rarely as many as three eggs are found in this nest in color they somewhat resemble the birds plumage and in size they are larger than hens eggs those two things like horns that the eagleowl has on its headare they ears asked emile no my boy they are egrets upstanding feathers that give the bird a warlike appearance its ears are not visible being hidden by the plumage they are very large and deep which explains why the eagleowls hearing is so wonderfully acute the eagleowl louis here observed eats fieldmice and rats for which it is to be thanked but it also eats young hares and young rabbits isnt that a pity for the hunter i admit but for the farmer it is quite another thing dont forget that the hare and the rabbit belong to the order of rodents they have incisors which spare nothing in the fields if they were left to breed in peace they would prove a serious menace to our crops history tells of countries so ravaged by rabbits that it became necessary to send an army to help the inhabitants get rid of them we shall never reach that condition i am sure but it is no cause for regret that the eagleowl jointly with the hunter keeps the animals within tolerable bounds moreover the bird is very scarce everywhere one pair of these birds in a year is the most that you will find in the mountains about here an extensive huntingground is required by such big eaters if they are not to starve one another out i have a more serious complaint to bring against the eagleowl when it cannot find its favorite gamemeadowmice fieldmice and ratsit contents itself with bats snakes toads lizards and frogs and thus deprives us of some of our best protectors be assured once for all that while we have some irreproachable helpers there are also others that from our point of view are guilty of a good many misdeeds bear in mind the mole which throws up the earth and cuts the roots of plants in its war on insects no animal gives a moments thought to manexcept the dog who is our friend even more than he is our servant no other pays any heed to our interests all work for themselves and their young if their instinct prompts them to destroy only species harmful to us so much the better they are excellent helpers but if they hunt both harmful and helpful species we must balance the total good against the total harm that they do if the good tips the scale let us respect the animal it is a helper if it does more harm than good let us declare war on the creature it is a ravager the eagleowl catches in the fields such formidable hoarders of grain as fieldmice and hamsters in gardens dormice and other lovers of fruit in the neighborhood of our houses ordinary mice and rats and even the horrible norway rat there you have the plea for the defendant on the other hand the hunter charges the bird with killing a certain number of young rabbits incautiously taking a taste or two of wild thyme by moonlight and with appropriating a few young hares that would otherwise be eaten by human beings for my part i accuse it of feeding its young on the serviceable toad the useful snake and the cricketeating lizard there you have the prosecutors charge but the balance being struck the birds services are found to outweigh its misdeeds and i declare that the eagleowl deserves well of the farmer it is a unanimous verdict declared jules the common horned owl or lesser eagleowl uncle paul continued is much like the bird we have been discussing only it is far smaller being very little larger than a crow while the other is the size of a goose it is the commonest of all the nocturnal birds of prey in these regions in the night hours throughout the summer it keeps repeating in melancholy accents its longdrawn and doleful cry of cloocloo which can be heard a long way off just as it takes flight it gives a sort of bitter sigh made no doubt by the air expelled from its lungs by the effort of the wings at the moment of flying off in the daytime confronted by human beings this bird wears a dazed and foolish expression it snaps its beak stamps its feet and moves its big head abruptly up and down and from side to side if attacked by too strong an enemy it lies down on its back and threatens its foe with claws and beak it inhabits ruined buildings caves in rocks and the hollow trunks of old trees seldom does it take the trouble to build a nest of its own preferring to patch up one that has been deserted by a magpie or a buzzard there it lays four or five round white eggs i will remark in passing that the eggs of nocturnal birds of prey are not oval like hens eggs but more nearly round the hunting habits of the horned owl are like those of the eagleowl it has the same liking for rodents such as fieldmice rats ordinary mice and meadowmice it pounces upon young rabbits in the same manner after patiently watching for them at the mouth of the burrow now let us pass on to another species the shorthorned owl or large sparrowowl resembles the lesser eagleowl in plumage and size the two egrets or plumicorns are very short and they seldom stand erect as in the two preceding species because of the shortness of these horns the large sparrowowl is often taken for a hornless owl this species is seldom seen near dwellinghouses preferring rocks quarries and ruined and solitary castles it builds no nest but is content to lay in a hole in some wall or rock two or three white eggs shiny and round and about as large as pigeons eggs its usual cry is goo uttered rather softly but if rain is coming the cry is changed to goyoo its diet is mostly confined to fieldmice and meadowmice the red owl is of about the blackbirds size its plumage is ashy gray mottled with red and marked with little flecks of black running lengthwise and fine gray lines running around the body it is the smallest and prettiest of our nocturnal birds of prey when its fine egrets stand up well on the forehead they give it a bold and martial air that goes well with its eagerness for the chase in the picture emile pointed out its horns are not standing up no the bird is represented in one of its peaceful moments there is nothing to arouse it nothing to attract its attention it has withdrawn into itself and is thinking of the fine feast it had when it last went hunting it is digesting that feast but let a mouse come and scratch anywhere near and the red owl immediately ruffles its foreheadthe first sign of attention it straightens up and spreads out its egretsa sign of the closest possible attention it has heard it has understood off darts the bird and the mouse is caught the smaller rodents are its delight it seasons them with beetles and junebugsespecially the latter which are an aid to digestion when larger game is lacking it contents itself with a frugal meal of insects hoping to make up for it soon with a good dinner of meadowmice red owls are great travelers they assemble in companies sometimes to migrate for the winter and seek a warmer clime sometimes to search out a district where there is plenty of game when their present haunts no longer offer enough to suffice them if fieldmice are on the increase in some particular region and are ravaging the fields of grain and hay the red owls hear of it i dont know how they spread the glad tidings all club together and start for the lands where feasting awaits them with such zeal do they apply themselves to the work of extermination that in a few weeks the fields are cleared of the infesting hordes red owls nest in hollow trees and clefts in rocks their eggs from two to four in a nest are of a shiny white other owls owls not belonging to the horned class lack of course the egrets or plumicorns characteristic of the latter the largest of the hornless owls is the howlet or tawny owl which is about as large as one of our domestic hens the predominating color of its plumage is grayish in the male and reddish in the female a difference that sometimes causes them to be mistaken for separate species on this background color is a sprinkling of light brown spots running lengthwise of the body and less numerous on the breast and stomach than elsewhere the wings are marked with several large white round spots the head is very large and nearly round the face sunken in the surrounding feathers and partly concealed by them the eyes likewise sunken are brown and surrounded with small gray feathers the name howlet is connected in its derivation with the word howl and the bird called by that name is indeed remarkable for its cry not unlike a wolfs howl when at the close of a somber winter day the wind whips the snow and moans in the trees one may often hear a frightful cry prolonged and mournful rising from the dark depths of the foresthoohoo hoohoo hoohoo then in the lonely cottage the frightened mother makes the sign of the cross while her little ones press close to her crying and saying the wolves are coming dont be uneasy good people it is not a wolf it is an owl hoohooing sounding its warcry from the top of some hollow oak and getting ready for its nightly rounds in summertime the howlet lives in the woods it hunts by preference fieldmice and meadowmice which it swallows whole afterward throwing up the skin and bones rolled into a ball the little birds that worry it so unmercifully in the daytime whenever they get a chance to come upon it unawares in the sunlight are not safe from its beak in the hours of darkness if the nightbird can pounce upon them after first frightening them with its terrible hoohoo keep as still as mice in your hidingplaces you finches and redbreasts and tomtits and dont betray yourselves by giving voice to your alarm let the owl hoohoo as much as it pleases if you make a sound you are lost if the fields prove disappointing as a huntingground the owl makes bold to approach dwellinghouses and finds its way into barns there to play the part of cat and thus make good the title of hooting cat which has been given it for patience and skill in catching rats and mice it rivals raminagrobis 4 himself it is a guest to be treated with respect when hunger compels it to visit our granaries after completing its nightly rounds it returns to the woods early in the morning hides in the densest thickets or in the trees having the most abundant foliage and there passes the day silent and motionless in winter its home is always in the hollow of some old tree trunk it lays its eggs in the abandoned nests of magpies crows buzzards and kestrels and these eggs of a dingy gray color are about as large as a pullets but nearly round the belfryowl also known as the barnowl is an ungainly bird rather smaller than the howlet its plumage however is not wanting in elegance being red on the back sprinkled with gray and brown and prettily dotted with white points alternating with dark ones and white underneath with or without brown spots the eyes are deepset and each is encircled by a ring of fine white feathers almost like hair a little collar bordered with red frames the face the beak is whitish and the claws are covered only with a soft white down very short under which the pink flesh can be seen this bird has none of the proud bearing of the eagleowl and the red owl it carries itself awkwardly with an embarrassed almost shamefaced look humpbacked and with wings hanging down face sad and scowling and legs long and ungainlysuch is the barnowls appearance in repose as if to complete its ungraceful attitude the bird whenever anything disturbs it teeters from side to side in a ludicrous fashion with haggard eyes and wings slightly raised and what is the teetering for asked jules no doubt to frighten its enemy in time of danger the barnowl utters a harsh grating crycraa craa craawhich often frightens away the enemy the owls habitual cry in the silence of the night is a mournful heavy breathing not unlike the snoring of a man sleeping with his mouth open to these cries add the darkness of the night the near neighborhood of churches and cemeteries and you will understand how the innocent barnowl has managed to frighten children women and even men you will be able to see why it has the reputation of being a funeral bird the bird of death summoning to the cemetery one of the persons living in the house it visits the french name effraie fright has reference to these superstitious terrors it designates the bird that frightens with its nightly chant those who are foolish enough to believe in ghosts and sorcerers it may practise its chant on our roof as much as it likes jules declared boldly it wont scare me a bit nor would it scare any one else if everybody would listen to reason instead of putting faith in ridiculous stories fear like cruelty is the daughter of ignorance train your reason accustom yourselves to see things as they really are and foolish fears will be banished the barnowl also goes by the name of belfryowl because it likes to make its home in old church towers sometimes it will enter a church by night to hunt mice those who first came upon the illfamed bird near the altar did not fail to accuse it of drinking oil from the lamp or rather of eating it when it is congealed by the cold the charge itself proves its own falsity as oil cannot congeal in a lamp that is always kept burning but the slanderers do not trouble themselves about a little thing like that when they wish to blacken the birds reputation they will continue for a long time if not forever to regard the owl as a profaner of holy lamps in provence they will always call this bird the oildrinker in reality the barnowl lives on rats and mice which it catches in barns and churches on fieldmice meadowmice and dormice which it hunts in gardens and fields here beyond a doubt we have a service rendered that ought to make people forget its false reputation make them like and protect it as it deserves will the bird that gives us very real help and is guiltless of a single offense ever be declared innocent i very much doubt it superstition is so deeprooted that there will never be lacking a oneeyed john to nail a live owl to his door the barnowl likes to live in inhabited regions the roofs of churches summits of steeples high towersthese are its favorite haunts all day it remains crouching in some dark hole from which it does not come out until after sunset its manner of taking flight deserves mention first it lets itself fall from the summit of its steeple like a dead weight and it does not spread its wings until after a rather long vertical drop it then pursues a zigzag course making no more noise than if the wind bore it along it is fond of nesting in abandoned ruins in the hollow trunks of wormeaten trees occasionally in barns high up on some beam but it builds no nest to hold its eggs which are laid on the spot that may have been selected with no leaves roots or hair to serve as bedding the laying takes place toward the end of march and is limited to five or six white eggs remarkable for their oval shape an exceptional shape for nocturnal birds of prey the little ones with their large eyes beak stretched open for food and rumpled down are the ugliest creatures imaginable the mother feeds them with insects and bits of mouseflesh the smallest of our hornless owls is the sparrowowl like the red owl it is about the size of a blackbird it is dark brown in color with large white spots of a round or oval shape the throat is white and the tail is crossed by four narrow whitish stripes the sparrowowl has a quick and light bearing and it sees by day much better than other night birds therefore it sometimes chases small birds but rarely with success when it has the good luck to catch one it plucks it very clean before eating it instead of following the gluttonous example of the horned owls and the howlet which swallow such prey whole and throw the feathers up later its hunting expeditions are much more fruitful when directed against fieldmice and common mice which it dismembers before eating other owls make but one mouthful of their prey the sparrowowl tears to pieces the animal it has caught perhaps so that it may enjoy the flavor more to express astonishment surprise fear the barnowl waddles in a most ridiculous manner but the sparrowowl adopts another method it bows its legs crouches down and then abruptly rises lengthening its neck and turning its head to right and left you would say it was moved by springs from within this performance is repeated over and over again each time accompanied by a clacking of the beak in flight the birds habitual cry is poo poo poo at rest it says aymay aidmay repeated several times in quick succession in a tone almost human the sparrowowl lives in deserted buildings quarries old and dilapidated towers but never in hollow trees it frequents the roofs of churches and of village houses its nest consists of a hole in a rock or a wall where it lays four or five round white eggs somewhat speckled with red the eagle if it were my purpose to give you a systematic and scientific account of birds instead of acquainting you with the various species useful to agriculture i ought to have begun with birds that hunt by day and to have postponed my talks on those that hunt by night in other words the eagle the falcon and the hawk should have been described first but should you ask me why i should be rather at a loss for a satisfactory answer for want of a better let us content ourselves with this one the first do their work by day the second at night but the eagle and the others of that group live at our expense while the horned owl and its kind render us a great service by holding in check what would else be a disastrous multiplication of rodents consequently in point of usefulness the nightbird comes first but this is contrary to all usage both scientific and popular which puts the eagle first in the list of birds do we not say of the eagle that it is the king of birds why has this title been given to the fierce bandit the murderer of lambs i should be puzzled to answer this question did i not know mans inclination to glorify brute strength even though he himself may be its victim you my children will find that out only too soon to your sorrow plunder on a grand scale appeals alas to something in our faulty human nature that makes us excuse it nay more that makes us glorify it whereas productive toil useful to all leaves us cold or even disdainful the falcon is a ravisher of our henhouses a bloodthirsty marauder of our dovecotes and we hold it in high esteem calling it a noble bird shall we then never learn to judge animals and men by their true worth their real usefulness let us hope that as so many fine minds have worked are working and always will work to bring about this miracle you my children will some day follow their example work for this end with all your power and blessings be upon you if you succeed in giving some additional strength however little it may be to this common effort put forth by all men of light and leading i shall discuss but briefly the birds of prey whose activities are confined to the daylight hours they are nearly all bandits nothing else living at our cost by robbery and murder from the fact that they hunt by day never at night they are called diurnal or day birds of prey the brightest light does not dazzle them it is even said of the eagle and others of this class that they can look straight at the sun and this is credited to them as an added title of nobility but there is no great merit in this performance when once you know how they shade their eyes in accomplishing it they have three eyelids to each eye first two like ours an upper and a lower which close in sleep and then a third which is semitransparent and is withdrawn completely into the corner of the eye when the bird has no use for it but when needed comes out from under the other two which remain open and serves as a curtain if the light is too bright or the bird wishes to look toward the sun it has merely to draw over the eye this third eyelid this eyeshade through the semitransparency of which the rays of light enter the pupil in a much subdued intensity there you have the whole secret of the eagles bold look in facing the sun i could do as much if i shaded my eyes with a curtain emile declared all these birds are furnished with a very strong beak having hooked mandibles for dismembering their prey their claws are composed of four separate talons to each foot three of these talons pointing forward and one backward the talons are long recurved and grooved on the under side the grooves having sharp edges that they may the better cut into flesh the eagles bearing is bold its looks stern and its flight marvelously powerful eagles like to circle about in the air to soar with scarcely a movement of the wings in the upper regions of the atmosphere beyond our view nevertheless even from this immense height they can distinguish what is taking place on the earths surface below they explore every farm with their piercing eyes and inspect every poultryyard let a suitable prey show itself and instantly the bird swoops down with whistling wing faster than lead would fall the unwary fowl is snatched from under the farmers very eyes fortunately the eagle the chief of these bandits is a very rare bird in form it is large measuring a meter and more from the tip of the beak to the tip of the tail and it is covered with brown plumage its extended wings measure a span of nearly three meters its fierce eye overshadowed by a very prominent eyebrow glows with a somber fire the eagles nest is known as its aery and is flat instead of bowlshaped like other birds nests it is a sort of solid floor made of interwoven twigs and covered with a bed of rushes and heather it is commonly placed on the face of some steep and forbidding precipice and between two rocks the upper one of which overhangs and forms a kind of roof for the nest the eggs two in numbersometimes though rarely threeare of a dingy white spotted with red the young eaglets are so greedy that at the time of their rearing the aery is strewn with bits of bleeding flesh some neighboring ledge of rock serves the parents as slaughterhouse and cuttingup bench it is there that the hares and rabbits partridges and ducks lambs and kids seized in the plains and carried in rapid flight to the lofty heights where the eagle makes its home are torn to pieces in order to be fed to the everhungry eaglets is the eagle really strong enough asked emile to carry off a lamb like that i had heard it but couldnt believe it nothing is less open to doubt his uncle assured him it would carry you off if it found you alone in the mountains i could defend myself with a stick possibly but let me tell you an incident one of many to be found in the pages of an author whose word we may believe two little girls one five years old the other three were playing together when a mediumsized eagle suddenly swooped down upon the elder and despite her companions cries and in the very face of some workmen who came hurrying to the spot snatched her up into the air two months later a shepherd found on a rock half a league distant the body of the child half devoured and dried up what do you think now of the eagle the king of birds i think its a brigand of the worst kind affirmed jules would you like to see an eagle in the act of hunting witness its fierce joy when it buries its hooked talons in the quivering flesh of its prey then listen to this fine passage from the pen of that ardent lover of birds audubon the scene is laid far from here in america and the eagle belongs to a different species from ours but never mind the ways of these bandits are the same everywhere to give you some idea of the nature of this bird permit me to place you on the mississippi on which you may float gently along while approaching winter brings millions of waterfowl on whistling wings from the countries of the north to seek a milder climate in which to sojourn for a season the eagle is seen perched in an erect attitude on the highest summit of the tallest tree by the margin of the broad stream his glistening but stern eye looks over the vast expanse he listens attentively to every sound that comes to his quick ear from afar glancing now and then on the earth beneath lest even the light tread of the fawn may pass unheard his mate is perched on the opposite side and should all be tranquil and silent warns him by a cry to continue patient at this well known call the male partly opens his broad wings inclines his body a little downwards and answers to her voice in tones not unlike the laugh of a maniac the next moment he resumes his erect attitude and again all around is silent ducks of many species the teal the wigeon the mallard and others are seen passing with great rapidity and following the course of the current but the eagle heeds them not they are at that time beneath his attention the next moment however the wild trumpetlike sound of a yet distant but approaching swan is heard a shriek from the female eagle comes across the streamfor she is as fully on the alert as her mate the latter suddenly shakes the whole of his body and with a few touches of his bill aided by the action of his cuticular muscles arranges his plumage in an instant the snowwhite bird is now in sight her long neck is stretched forward her eye is on the watch vigilant as that of her enemy her large wings seem with difficulty to support the weight of her body although they flap incessantly so irksome do her exertions seem that her very legs are spread beneath her tail to aid her in her flight she approaches however the eagle has marked her for his prey as the swan is passing the dreaded pair the male bird in full preparation for the chase starts from his perch with an awful scream that to the swans ear brings more terror than the report of the large duckgun now is the moment to witness the display of the eagles powers he glides through the air like a falling star and like a flash of lightning comes upon the timorous quarry which now in agony and despair seeks by various manœuvres to elude the grasp of his cruel talons it mounts doubles and willingly would plunge into the stream were it not prevented by the eagle which long possessed of the knowledge that by such a stratagem the swan might escape him forces it to remain in the air by attempting to strike it with his talons from beneath the hope of escape is soon given up by the swan it has already become much weakened and its strength fails at the sight of the courage and swiftness of its antagonist its last gasp is about to escape when the ferocious eagle strikes with his talons the under side of its wings and with unresisted power forces the bird to fall in a slanting direction upon the nearest shore it is then reader that you may see the cruel spirit of this dreaded enemy of the feathered race whilst exulting over his prey he for the first time breathes at ease he presses down his powerful feet and drives his sharp claws deeper than ever into the heart of the dying swan he shrieks with delight as he feels the last convulsions of his prey which has now sunk under his unceasing efforts to render death as painfully felt as it can possibly be the female has watched every movement of her mate and if she did not assist him in capturing the swan it was not from want of will but merely that she felt full assurance that the power and courage of her lord were quite sufficient for the deed she now sails to the spot where he eagerly awaits her and when she has arrived they together turn the breast of the luckless swan upwards and gorge themselves with gore 5 poor swan was emiles pitying comment hawks and falcons what are we to do with enemies like the eagle asked louis when uncle paul had finished audubons account of that birds fierce and destructive rapacity destroy them was the reply destroy them by every possible means for we can count on no assistance from other than human helpers eagles are the tyrants of the air and no other bird dares attack them the destruction of their nests is the surest way to put an end to the ravages they from time to time commit among our flocks but it is an enterprise not without danger to make ones way to the eagles aery and wring the necks of the young birds the shepherds of the pyrenees go about this work in couples one armed with a doublebarreled rifle and the other with a long pike at daybreak when the eagle is already away hunting the two nestdestroyers climb to the top of the steep declivity where the aery is situated the first man the one armed with the rifle posts himself on the rocky summit to fire at the eagle if it returns while the second his pike fastened to his belt clambers down from rock to rock to the aery and removes the eaglets which are still too young to offer serious resistance but at their first cry of distress the mother hastens to the rescue and hurls herself furiously at her enemy who receives her with blows of his pike until his comrade brings her down with a wellaimed shot the male until then soaring among the clouds now descends like a thunderbolt and is on the hunters head before the man has time to use his pike fortunately a second bullet from the rifleman stationed above breaks the birds wing what if he had missed the bird asked jules then it would have been all over with his companion his face torn by the eagles beak and his eyes pecked out he would have fallen to the foot of the precipice a mangled corpse no it is hardly a holiday diversion to go birdnesting among the haunts of the eagle im sure i shouldnt care to undertake it was juless comment next to the eagle the goshawk is the largest of our diurnal birds of prey it is a magnificent creature about the size of a wellgrown rooster brown above and white underneath with numerous little dark stripes running around the body the eye is adorned with a white eyebrow the beak is blueblack and the feet are yellow the goshawk is the scourge of pigeoncotes for which reason it is also called the pigeons falcon it selects for itself a lofty perch on some tall tree and there keeps a watchful eye on the flocks of pigeons foraging in the fields woe betide the luckless one that forgets for a moment to be on its guard the bird pounces upon it in oblique flight almost skimming the surface of the ground and in less than no time the pigeon is seized and carried off to some lonely rock where the ravisher plucks its feathers and tears it to pieces while still warm if the farmer is not on the lookout the goshawk attacks the poultry and does great harm at the mere appearance of the birds shadow the rooster raises a cry of alarm and the little chickens hastily take refuge under their mothers wing while she her feathers ruffled and her eyes blazing sometimes succeeds in frightening off the enemy by her show of boldness for lack of pigeons and barnyard fowls the goshawk hunts young hares squirrels and small birds and in time of famine it will even eat moles and mice wooded mountains are its favorite abode and it builds its nest in the tallest oaks and beeches its eggs four or five in number are slightly red or bluish and spotted with brown the common sparrowhawk is about as large as a magpie its plumage somewhat resembles the goshawks being ashy blue on the back and white underneath with brown stripes running crosswise the throat and breast are reddish and the tail is barred with six or seven dark bands the legs and claws are of a beautiful yellow and are long and slender the sparrowhawk is a hunter of pigeons which it tries to catch off guard by flying around the pigeoncote and by watching from the concealment of some treetop the lark the thrush and the quail often fall into its clutches its flight is low and oblique like the goshawks the wings of both being too short and too rounded at the tip to permit of lofty flight or sudden charges the young just out of the nest and as yet inexperienced in the cunning of the chase are for a while trained by the parent birds for the career they are to follow and indeed it is no rare occurrence to see the whole family hunting in company the sparrowhawk nests in tall trees and lays four or five white eggs ornamented with brown spots which are larger and more numerous toward the big end of the egg both the goshawk and the sparrowhawk when they are attacked by an enemy stronger than themselves do as the horned owl does they lie on their backs and brandish their claws of all our diurnal birds of prey falcons are the most courageous and the best equipped for flying as a distinctive characteristic they have a sharp tooth on each side of the tip of the beak which itself is very powerful and curves downward in a notable manner from the very outset their wings are pointed at the tip and when folded they extend beyond or at least as far as the end of the tail all falcons soar in their flight when hunting to this class belong the common falcon the hobby and the merlin the common falcon which is as large as a hen can be recognized by a sort of mustache or black spot it has on each cheek its back is of a dark ashen hue crossed by narrow stripes of a still deeper shade the throat and breast are pure white with black markings running lengthwise the stomach and thighs are light gray tinged with blue and striped with black and the tail shows alternate stripes of dingy white and of black the beak is blue with a black tip and the eyes and legs are a beautiful yellow but it should be added that the plumage of the common falcon varies a good deal with age and not until the bird is three or four years old does it agree with the description i have just given the summits of the wildest and loftiest crags are the falcons home whence it goes forth to hunt pigeons quails partridges chickens and ducks it rises and soars some time in the air searching for its victims and then swoops down upon them like a missile hurled from the sky with astonishing boldness it makes its way into the farmers pigeoncotes and chases the pigeons themselves under the very eyes of passersby in the middle of crowded streets it will even snatch partridges from before the hunters rifle and from under the huntingdogs nose its cry is strong and piercing and it flies unwearied at the rate of twenty leagues an hour for hundreds of leagues but its walk is jerky and awkward because its hooked claws furnished with long and recurved nails rest insecurely on the ground the falcon nests on the southern face of rocky precipices the nest itself being clumsily built and holding three or four eggs of a reddish hue spotted with brown the hobby is smaller than the common falcon it is brown above and whitish beneath with thighs and the lower part of the stomach red its boldness is equaled only by the falcons for it gives chase to larks and quails even when the hunter is in the act of shooting them and dashes into the midst of the fowlers net to seize the decoy birds it perches on tall trees and nests in their branches its eggs are whitish with a few red spots the merlin is the smallest of the diurnal birds of prey being scarcely larger than a thrush it is brown on the back and whitish with brown spots underneath its nest which is seldom found in our part of the country is built in the hollow of a rock and contains five or six whitish eggs marbled at the larger end with brown and dingy green despite its smallness it is a bold bandit little birds are terrorstricken at the mere sound of the merlins wings in their neighborhood even the partridge is not safe from its attacks it begins by separating one of the birds from the rest of the covey and then circling about above it in a spiral which grows smaller and smaller it descends until it can reach its victim with its claws and knocks it down with a blow on the breast such are the principal diurnal birds of prey that we have to make war upon without mercy up and after these savage bloodsuckers destroyers of game ravagers of poultryyards and pigeoncotes take your gun vigilant farmer watch for the falcon and the goshawk and let fire at those brigands destroy their nests break their eggs and wring the necks of their young if you wish to save your chickens ducks and pigeons kestrels kites and buzzards the kestrel belongs to the falcon family as may be seen from the small sharp tooth on each side of the tip of the beak it is rather a handsome bird about the size of a pigeon red in color with black spots and a white tip to the tail the beak is blue and the legs are yellow the kestrel is the most widely scattered bird of prey and the one most often seen near human habitations its favorite haunts are old castles lofty towers and belfries one often sees it flying with untiring wing around these buildings uttering the while a piercing cry plee plee plee pree pree pree which it sends forth to frighten the sparrows snuggling in holes in the wall so that it may seize them when they fly out it carefully plucks the little captured birds before eating them but it has another kind of prey which gives it less trouble and that is the mouse which it enters open barns in order to catch also the fat and savory fieldmouse which it spies from on high when holding itself motionless in the air in one position with tail and wings gracefully extended what will it do with its catch will it skin the creature for the sake of cleanliness as it plucks the sparrow no the common mouse and the fieldmouse are dainty morsels of which the kestrel would be loath to lose a single drop of blood the rodent is swallowed just as it is whole if small piecemeal if large after digestion the skin and bones are thrown up through the beak in the form of little balls just as in the case of the owl the kestrel nests in old towers abandoned ruins hollow rocks its nest made of twigs and roots holds four or five rustcolored eggs marbled with brown we will pass now to the kite which is different from all other birds of prey with its broad and forked tail its very long wings its rather slender claws and its very small beak a beak not at all in keeping with the birds size which exceeds that of the falcon this beak makes the bird cowardly to excess frightened by the slightest danger put to flight by a mere crow if pressed by hunger however the kite will venture into the neighborhood of pigeoncotes and poultryyards in order to seize young pigeons and little chickens fortunately the hen if she has time to gather her brood under her wings can scare the invader away by simply showing her anger for want of poultry the kite which is hated by thrifty country people attacks reptiles rats fieldmice and meadowmice and if it can get nothing else it will content itself with carrion such as dead sheep and spoiled fish the kites extended wings measure more than a meter and a half from tip to tip and its flight presents a fine spectacle when the bird sweeps in wide circles through the upper atmosphere it is as if it were swimming gliding without the least apparent exertion then all at once it stops in its flight and remains suspended in one position for a quarter of an hour at a stretch held there by an invisible movement of the wings the kite is of a deep red hue on the back and rustcolored on the breast and stomach with a whitish head and the large wingfeathers black its cry resembles a cats mewing it builds its nest in tall trees or still oftener in the hollows of rocks its eggs commonly three in number are white shading into dingy yellow and speckled with a few irregular brown spots the birds known as harriers have a small semicircular collar of fine thick feathers projecting from each side of the face and reaching from beak to ear much like the ring around the hornless owls eyes in the contour of the breast in the long legs and wings and in the still longer tail they have something of the falcons appearance and bearing while in their large head and in the little collar around the face they are not unlike the nocturnal birds of prey harriers frequent marshes and the banks of stagnant bodies of water where they lie concealed among the rushes in order to seize any small rodents reptiles or insects that may come within their reach the farmer has no complaint to bring against them as they show proper respect for his little pigeons chickens and ducklings indeed they are welcome visitors on account of their strong liking for fieldmice unfortunately the hunter accuses them of killing game especially waterfowl hares and rabbits in this connection it is to be noted that the weasel a small carnivorous quadruped with a thirst for blood is wont to make its way into warrens in quest of young hares and rabbits in order to suck their blood after which the dead bodies are left behind some bush these murderous operations do not escape the harriers vigilance in its leisurely flights it keeps a sharp eye on the surroundings of all warrens in the woods for the purpose of carrying off any dead bodies and feasting on the weasels leavings that it may occasionally be at fault and mistake a live rabbit for a dead one i should not dare deny but after all i forgive it willingly enough and in consideration of its war on fieldmice i should be inclined to bestow upon it the honorable title of farmers helper if we may feel some uncertainty about harriers there is no such doubt concerning buzzards in them we certainly have very valuable helpers large eaters of fieldmice and meadowmice and great destroyers of moles those tireless burrowers whose numbers must be kept within strict limits buzzards have a short wide beak curving downward from the base wings very long but not pointed reaching almost to the tip of the tail strong legs and the space between the eyes and nostrils bristling with hairs buzzards are fond of repose and phlegmatic by nature or it might be more accurate to say that they are endowed with a remarkable capacity for patient and motionless waiting a gift very necessary for the successful hunting of the fieldmouse which must be watched for by the hour at the mouth of its burrow for half a day at a time if need be the buzzard lies in wait without making the least movement or giving the slightest sign of impatience one would take it to be asleep then all of a sudden the bird falls to hacking the soil with its beak and tearing the turf with its powerful claws a disemboweled mole is brought to light or perhaps a fieldmouse is the prize and in either event the victim is no sooner caught than swallowed now do you know what reputation the buzzard has won by this habit of long and motionless waiting so indispensable in the quest of game with the acuteness of hearing characteristic of the mole and of rodents the reputation of stupidity we say of a person of limited intelligence that he is as stupid as a buzzard here again is an instance of that wrongheadedness which makes us think little of so many of our helpers and glorify those that prey upon us stupidity is the name we give to the buzzards peculiarities and for no better reason than that the bird spares our poultryyards and rids us of troublesome rodents whereas we speak of the eagle which steals our lambs and of the falcon plunderer of chickencoops as courageous noble and splendid the common buzzard is a large brown bird with a whitish throat stomachfeathers marked with little lines alternately brown and white and tail crossed by nine or ten dark stripes its beak is whitish at the base and black at the tip its eyes and legs yellow this species nests in tall trees the nest being made of interwoven twigs and lined with wool and hair it lays but three eggs at most which are whitish and irregularly sprinkled with dingy yellow spots it is the common buzzard especially that has won the reputation of stupidity with its leisurely flying and its patience in watching for prey it usually watches on some mound of earth observers who have studied its habits say that sixteen is about the number of mice it commonly eats in one day which makes nearly six thousand a year thats the kind of bird we should like to have about our houses if we could only tame it remarked jules there is nothing to prevent our trying it his uncle rejoined the buzzards disposition is good enough other observers who have studied its hunting of fieldmice estimate that it eats nearly four thousand of these in one year from this number you can form some idea of the multitude of little rodents a whole flock of buzzards would be able to destroy but we must not give the bird too much praise i know that it does not hesitate when occasion offers to seize and carry off a wounded young hare and i also know that when the snow is on the ground and the buzzard is pressed by hunger it will pounce upon any stray chicken that may have got out of the poultryyard but what are these few acts of theft when compared with the thousands of rodents of all kinds that it clears away from our fields whatever the season of the year one cannot open a buzzards crop without finding common mice fieldmice and meadowmice there by the dozen if i owned a field that was ravaged by these rodents i should lose no time in planting a few stumps there to serve as perches and watchtowers for buzzards in their patient hunt for their favorite game there is another variety of buzzard the hawkbuzzard that does us good service in its fondness for larvæ caterpillars and insects generally particularly wasps what those wasps that hurt so when they sting asked emile yes my boy this buzzard feasts on the wasps whose sting is so painful to us it swallows them without a thought of their sting just as the hedgehog devours the viper and never worries about its venomous fangs the bird attacks their nests with its beak and pulls out the nymphs from their cells carrying them fat and tender to its little ones this buzzard is a somewhat smaller bird than the common buzzard its back is brown its throat light yellow with brown stripes and its breast and stomach white sprinkled with dark heartshaped spots the tail is crossed by three wide dark bands the beak is black and finally the head of the old male is bluishgray the bird nests in woods in tall trees and its eggs are rather small being yellowishwhite in color but with so thick a sprinkling of large brown spots as sometimes almost to hide the color underneath the featherlegged buzzard has legs covered with long feathers as in certain species of pigeons bearing the same qualifying name it frequents river banks uncultivated fields and woods and lives on fieldmice moles reptiles and if need be on insects here let us bring to a close our talk on birds of prey i have told you about the more important ones both diurnal and nocturnal about their habits their food and the services or the harm they do us it is now for you to add to what these brief talks have taught you by observing the things that come under your eyes every day do not fail to examine with some care the buzzard as you see it perched on a mound and patiently watching for a fieldmouse also the kestrel as it flies screaming around the belfry and pounces sometimes on a mouse sometimes on a sparrow and the kite too as it soars on motionless wings in the blue sky you will get from this sort of study first a great deal of pleasure and secondly knowledge that will be highly useful if you ever have a farm or a garden it seems to me said jules that you have left out the very commonest of the birds of prey the crows crows are not birds of prey replied uncle paul they have not the hooked beak the clutching claws or the sharp curved nails of birds formed for a life of rapine i will tell you about them tomorrow or rather i will begin with that one of the crow family known as the raven the raven their black plumage and similarity of shape make us mistake all sorts of birds for crows let us begin with one of these the raven this bird is of good size being about as large as our domestic rooster and it has a hoarse cry uttered slowlycraa craa craa it is the raven that has won such a reputation with children from that famous fable about the raven and the fox yes i know emile hastened to interpose you mean the one that begins master raven perched on a tree held a piece of cheese in his beak where do you suppose he got that cheese history remains silent on that important question but my opinion would be that he stole it from some windowsill where the farmers wife had put out some newly made cheese to dry in a little wicker basket the fox says good morning to mr raven and praises his plumage continued emile and he goes on how trig and trim you are how handsome you look to me and so on and so forth how could the raven help having a swelled head after such flattery that fox was certainly a cunning rogue to make sure that the bird will listen instead of beginning with flattery that might have aroused his intended victims suspicions for the bird was not altogether lacking in common sense he began by praising what is really not without merit on a near view the raven is seen to be not by any means of a dead black it shows glints of purple and blue on the back and a flickering greenish tinge on the stomach the total effect being that of some highly polished metal at the first flattering words you may be sure the raven cast a complacent glance at its costume and seeing it brilliant with blue purple and green found it quite as rich as the fox declared it to be so now the bird was well preparedready for the fulsome flattery that was to follow the fox would have it believe the offensive odor clinging to it from eating so much carrion to be the aroma of musk and its hoarse croaking to be melodious warbling but just there was the difficulty to make it croak and thus open its mouth which held the cheese         and if that voice of thine         can match thy plumage fine     thou art the very phenix of all the woods around quoted emile yes thats it said uncle paul do you see how the sly rascal is making headway he would have the raven believe itself a singer mistake its raucous craa craa for the note of the nightingale had he begun with any such extravagant compliment he would have defeated his own ends but he very cleverly led up to this supreme flattery and to pique the ravens foolish vanity still further gave a doubtful tone to his admiration i know was what he seemed to the bird to say that your voice is widely celebrated but what i am not so sure of is whether it matches your splendid plumage whether you can really sing in a manner worthy of so magnificent a costume i must hear you and if your vocal performance equals your outward appearance then you will indeed prove yourself to be the paragon of birds the very phenix of these forests ah you doubt it said the raven to itself well then listen to this operatic trill craa craa craa emile again took up the fable         and so to prove it could         its boastfulness make good     it opened wide its beak and thus let fall the cheese     which master fox did seize not so fast his uncle interrupted him master fox could not have gone on talking with the cheese in his mouth he could not have pointed the moral in that neat little lesson with which the fable ends i can see him putting his paw on the prize while he licks his chops and looks tauntingly at the shamefaced bird my good sir he says let me call your attention to the fact that you are a conceited nincompoop he doesnt call the bird mr raven any more now that hes got hold of the cheese emile observed no to call him that was all very well in the beginning it flattered the bird but now the fox makes fun of his dupe and calls him my good sir in a tone of patronizing condolence to express pity for those we have cajoled and deceivedis not that the very perfection of roguery there we have most assuredly a fox that will make his way in the world read in la fontaine the incomparable storyteller the abominable tricks master reynard plays later on the goat the wolf and many others or better wait a while and we will read them together next winter before the open fire for the present we will leave the raven of the fable and try to learn something about the real ravens manner of living ravens do not flock together as crows do but live alone or in pairs on rocky heights and in the tallest trees the society or even the near neighborhood of its fellows is unbearable to a raven with angry peckings it drives away from its chosen district any of its kind that may try to establish themselves there even though they may have been born in the same nest if the intruder is merely a bird of passage it is conducted with menacing demonstrations to the frontiers of the domain and is jealously watched until it disappears in the distance crows social creatures are treated in the same way the raven asks to be left alone quite alone on its bare rock and woe to the illadvised intruder that disturbs its solitude it builds its nest in the topmost branches of a solitary tree or still more to its liking in some fissure that offers itself in the perpendicular face of a rocky precipice the nest is made of sticks and roots on the outside and of moss hair rags and fine grasses within i should like to know said jules what ravens eggs are like birds eggs are usually remarkable for their beauty both in shape and in color and for this reason if for no other they merit our attention but it is no idle or merely ornamental accomplishment to be able to distinguish one from another to know whether any given egg belongs to a useful species that should be respected or to a harmful species that should not be allowed to breed in the vicinity of our fields and gardens with this end in view i have already told you the characteristic marks of the eggs of our principal birds of prey some of which eggs should be destroyed without any consideration while others should be protected as this is a matter that interests you i will continue in the same way and will describe the eggs of those birds that we are still to talk about know then that ravens eggs are much more beautifully colored than might be expected from the somber plumage of the bird they are bluish green with brown spots this background of bluish green sometimes lighter and sometimes darker occurs again together with the brown spots in the eggs of crows magpies jays blackbirds thrushes and fieldfares birds that resemble one another closely in their bodily structure despite their marked differences in size plumage and habits the eggs of certain blackbirds and fieldfares are of a magnificent skyblue color the raven is an omnivorous creature fruit larvæ insects sprouting grain flesh whether in a fresh condition or otherwise all suit it equally well but its favorite fare is carrion which it knows how to find a long way off guided by sight and smell wherever there is a dead animal there the raven makes its appearance and contends for the loathsome quarry with dogs the habit of gorging itself with this infected food gives it a repulsive odor for lack of dead preythe sort most acceptable to its tastes its great appetite and its cowardicethe raven hunts such live prey as young hares and young rabbits and other small and destructive rodents it pilfers from birds nests both eggs and newborn birds a succulent banquet for its young and it even has the boldness to carry off little chickens from poultryyards without offering the slightest plea in its favor i leave the raven to the hatred it has always incurred by reason of its funereal plumage its forbidding aspect its sinister croaking repulsive odor filthy greed and savage disposition the crow in france we have four kinds of crows the black crow the mantled daw the rook or harvest crow and the jackdaw or little belfry crow the black crow has the same plumage and the same general appearance as the raven but is onequarter smaller during the summer these birds live in pairs in the woods which they leave only to get something to eat in the spring their food consists of birds eggs especially the eggs of partridges which they know how to puncture skilfully so as to carry them to their young on the point of the beak like the raven this bird is fond of decayed flesh and little birds still covered with down crows attack small weak or wounded game and venture into poultryyards to carry off any unwary ducklings or little chickens that may have strayed away from their mothers spoiled fish worms insects fruit seeds according to season and locality fill their crop they especially like nuts which they know how to break by letting them fall from a sufficient height in winter black crows gather in large flocks either in an unmixed company or together with rooks and mantled daws they go wandering about in the fields mingling with the flocks and sometimes even alighting on a sheeps back to hunt for vermin under the wool they follow the plowman to feed on the larvæ turned up by his plowshare and they explore the seeded ground and eat recently sown grain made tender and sweet by germination toward evening they fly together to the tall trees of some neighboring wood where they chatter noisily as the sun sets and smooth their feathers and finally go to sleep these trees are meetingplaces where every evening the crows gather from different quarters sometimes from several miles around at daybreak they divide into flocks of greater or less size and disperse in all directions to hunt for food in the tilled fields at the end of winter this company is broken up the crows pair off and each pair chooses in the neighboring forests a district a quarter of a league in extent from which every other couple is excluded this arrangement ensuring sufficient subsistence for each establishment in the bird colony the nest is built in some tree of medium size and is made of small twigs and roots interwoven and rudely cemented with loam or horse dung a mattress of fine rootlets being laid inside if some bird of prey happens to come too near this nest its owners assail the intruder with fury and crack its skull with a blow of the beak good for you brave crows cried emile your enemies will think twice before they come and bother you i admire the courage of crows in protecting their young uncle paul admitted but i cannot forgive them their plundering of poultryyards their thefts of young birds and eggs and their upturning of seeded ground we must then include the black crow among bandits that are to be destroyed in the same class too we must place the mantled daw so called from the sort of grayishwhite cloak that reaches from the shoulders to the tail both in front and on the back the rest of the plumage is black with glints of blue like the ravens this bird comes to us toward the end of autumn joins the company of black crows and rooks and may be seen searching our fields for larvæ and sprouting grain on the seashore where its numbers are much greater than in the interior it lives on fish and mollusks cast up by the waves or left by fishermen only under dire necessity will it touch carrion the favorite food of the black crow and the raven in march the mantled daw leaves us to go and breed in the north the rook which is a little smaller than the black crow has the latters plumage but with more of a violet and coppery luster its beak too is more nearly straight and has a sharper tip it is readily distinguished from the crow and the raven by the characteristic mark of its occupation the skin of its forehead and around the beak being bare of feathers and looking white and powdery like a scar is the bird born like that not at all just as a workman handling rough and heavy objects makes his hands callous so the rook acquires by its work the rough and scaly skin so noticeable on its forehead it is a tireless digger and its beak is its pick which it thrusts into the ground as deeply as it can from constant friction with the soil the forehead and the base of the beak lose their feathers and become bald or even have the skin itself worn away so as to leave a rough scar the rooks object in this toilsome operation is to capture white worms and all the destructive larvæ that are such a scourge to our cultivated fields i saw some rooks one day hard at work in a waste tract of land lifting up and turning over the stones scattered here and there so eager were they that they sometimes threw the smaller stones as high as a mans head now guess what they were looking for so busily they were looking for insects and all sorts of vermin in this work of turning over stones and digging in the soil rooks cannot fail to injure their tool the beak and they must rub the feathers off from its base i should have a high opinion of these birds if they contented themselves with hunting insects but unfortunately they have a decided fondness for sprouting seeds a dainty dish that they exert all their ingenuity to procure it is said that they bury acorns and leave them in the ground until they begin to sprout and have lost their bitter taste when they dig them up and eat them what a bright idea emile exclaimed the hard bitter acorn is buried in the ground to get mellow and when the rook thinks it has stayed there just long enough he has so good a memory he can go and find it again and dig it up by that time it is just right to eat soft and sweet and a fine feast for mr rook so far there is nothing to find fault with said uncle paul a bushel more or less of acorns is a small matter and i willingly hand them over to the rooks to dispose of in their curious fashion but other sprouting seeds suit them equally well especially wheat which they can so easily procure in winter in the recently sown fields when i see a flock of rooks sedately pacing the furrows and plunging their beaks in here and there where the ground is softened by a thaw i know well enough those birds might pretend they were hunting for junebug larvæ but he would be a simpleton indeed who accepted this explanation at that time of year when the worms are all too deep in the ground for the rooks beak to reach them it is wheat they are really after and as rooks go in very large flocks which may even darken the sky in their flight you can easily understand that such reapers make short work of their harvest nor is that all in the autumn rooks consume great quantities of walnuts and chestnuts and in the spring they dig up potato fields to obtain the newly planted tubers couldnt they live on dead animals as the black crow and the raven do asked louis no a rook however hungry will not touch a dead animal it must have seeds and fruit or larvæ and insects and as it chooses one or the other of these kinds of food the rook is our foe or our friend so there are two opinions about the bird some persons remembering only its thefts would wage a relentless war against it feeling that each rook destroyed means a bushel of wheat gained others mindful chiefly of its destruction of larvæ and insects maintain that the rook deserves kind treatment at the farmers hands because it rids his fields of vermin following the plowman to pick up white worms in the furrows and plunging its sharp beak into the ground for the grubs of the junebug for these excellent reasons they declare the rook worthy of our protection then which of the two opinions are we to accept was louiss query to my thinking neither of them but something halfway between as in the case of the mole if white worms abound let us bear with the rook as it makes war on these enemies of ours but if we have no need of its help let us chase the bird from our fields in our warfare on destructive insects we have two real helpers the mole and the rook but unfortunately we have to weigh their ravages against their services accordingly let us treat them with forbearance if we have a worse ill to dread but rid ourselves of their presence if our fields are in good condition all the year round the rook lives with its own kind it goes in flocks to seek food and in flocks it chooses its breedingplace sometimes a single oak has a dozen nests with as many in each of the trees around over a large tract of ground there is great commotion in this aërial city at the time of nestbuilding for rooks are very clamorous and also much given to stealing from their neighbors when a young and inexperienced couple suspend building operations for a moment to go and get further material for construction the neighbors pillage the halfcompleted nest this one carries off a little stick that one a blade of grass and some moss to use in their own work on their return the robbed ones are thrown into a terrible passion accuse this one and that one take counsel with friends and attack the robbers furiously if the theft has not been cleverly concealed experienced couples never leave the nest unguarded but one stays and watches while the other goes for building material the jackdaw or little belfrycrow is all black and about the size of a pigeon like rooks these birds fly in flocks and nest with their own kind high towers old castles and the belfries of gothic churches are their favorite abode their nests which are made of a few sticks and a little straw sometimes are placed each by itself in a hole in the wall and sometimes are very near together in huddled groups the jackdaw when flying keeps uttering a harsh and piercing cry it feeds on insects worms larvæ and fruit but never on decayed flesh it renders us some service by clearing trees of caterpillars but i complain of it for hunting the eggs of little birds although jackdaws are always to be found about our old buildings they nevertheless move from place to place usually in large flocks sometimes of their own kind exclusively at other times in company with rooks and mantled daws woodpeckers in front of uncle pauls house there is a grove of beeches several centuries old its branches interlacing at a great height and forming a continuous canopy supported by hundreds of tree trunks as smooth and white as stone columns in the autumn that is where emile and jules go and hunt in the moss for mushrooms of all colors to show to their uncle who tells the boys how to distinguish the edible from the poisonous kinds there too they hunt for beetles the stagbeetle whose large fat head bears enormous branching nippers great black capricornbeetles that may be seen at sunset running along the dead branches and clinging to them as they go with their jointed antennæ which are longer than the insects body and longhorn beetles likewise furnished with antennæ of unusual length and also remarkable for their wing sheaths richly colored with blue or yellow or red with spots and stripes of black velvet a multitude of birds of many kinds make this grove their abode there the quarrelsome jay fights with one of its own species for the possession of a beechnut there the magpie chatters on a high branch and then flies down and alights in a neighboring field jerking up its tail and looking around with an air of defiance crows have their evening rendezvous there and there the woodpecker hammers away at old bark to make the insects come out so that it may snap them up with its viscous tongue listen to the bird at its work toc toc toc if it is interrupted in its task it flies away with a cry of teo teo teo repeated thirty or forty times in quick succession and resembling a noisy burst of laughter what bird is it that seems to be making fun of us with such loud laughter as it flies off emile and jules asked each other one day when they were watching from their window the woodpeckers and the jays at play in the branches of the old beechtrees jacques their uncles gardener heard them as he was watering the cabbage bed after finishing a series of little trenches to carry the water to all parts of the bed he came up to the window for a talk with the boys that bird you see there said he with green plumage and a red head is a woodpecker it has several different cries if it is going to rain it says plieu plieu in a longdrawn and plaintive tone when at work in order to keep up its spirits it every now and then gives a harsh cry tiackackan tiackackan so that the whole forest echoes with it in the nesting season it gives a quick teo teo teo just like what you heard a moment ago then it has its nest now in the beech grove asked jules it is at work on it for all the morning ive heard it hammering away with all its might you see it makes its nest in a hole that it hollows out by pecking the trunk of a tree with its beak its a fine beak it has too so hard and pointed that the bird is always afraid of going too deep into the wood so after two or three good hard pecks it skips round to the other side of the trunk to see if it hasnt bored clear through bah youre only in fun returned jules not at all protested jacques its what ive heard said and ive often seen the woodpecker hurry round to look at the other side of the trunk but the bird must have some other reason than just to see whether or not the tree is bored through im going to ask uncle ask him too if he knows the ironweed that the woodpecker rubs its beak on to make it harder than steel your ironweed sounds to me like a fairy tale well im only telling you what ive heard i dont know anything about it myself but they say its a very rare weed and that the woodpecker goes to look for it in the mountains so that it may harden and whet its beak on it and anything you touch to that weed becomes as hard as the best steel what a find that would be for my scythe and my hedgingbill my sickle and graftingknife i know many a man that would give a bag of gold for the woodpeckers secret the young cabbage plants had by this time received enough water and it was now the lettuces turn jacques went back to his work and left the boys to puzzle over the question whether or not there was any truth in this story of the woodpeckers fear lest it might bore through the tree trunk with each peck of its beak they brought the matter up that evening in their talk with their uncle there is both truth and falsehood in what my good jacques told you he said the true is what he saw with his own eyes the false what he repeats from hearsay among the country folk he told you correctly about the woodpeckers different cries which he knows so well from having heard them over and over again and he was right about the birds way of running around to the other side of the trunk that it has just struck several times with its beak all the rest is false or rather an amusing legend with a basis of fact which we will now examine woodpeckers live solely on insects and larvæ especially those species of insects and larvæ that are found in wood the large grubs of capricornbeetles stagbeetles longhorn beetles and others are their favorite dish to get at them they have to clear away the dead bark and bore into the wormeaten wood beneath the instrument used in this rough work is the birds beak which is straight and wedgeshaped square at the base fluted lengthwise and shaped at the point like a carpenters chisel it is so hard and durable that in order to account for a tool of such perfection some simpleminded woodcutter made up the story that has been repeated ever since the childish story of the ironweed need i tell you that there is nothing in the world that by its mere touch can give to objects the hardness of iron or steel i had my doubts jules declared when jacques was telling us about it i couldnt believe in his wonderful weed the woodpecker has no need to rub its beak against anything to give it the hardness necessary for the work to be done it is born with a good strong beak to begin with and keeps it to the end and that beak never has to be retempered it is the continuation of a very thick skull which can withstand rather violent shocks and it is operated by a short strong neck which can keep up its hammering without fatigue even should the bird wish to bore into the very heart of a tree trunk after it has drilled its hole the woodpecker darts into it an exceedingly long tongue wormshaped and viscousthat is coated with a sort of mucilage made by the salivaand armed with a hard barbed point with which it transfixes the larvæ that have been uncovered to climb the trunk of the tree to be operated upon and for hours at a time if need be to stay there where larvæ seem to be lurking the woodpecker has short muscular legs which end in stout claws each foot having four talons or toes two pointing forward and two backward armed with curved nails of great strength the birds way of standing on the vertical surface of a tree trunk is made possible not only by the division of its talons as i have described them with their strong nails clinging to rough bark but also by a third support furnished by the tail the large tail feathers are stiff slightly bent downward worn at the tip and supplied with rough barbs when the woodpecker starts in on what promises to be a long job it plants itself firmly on the tripod of its tail and two feet and holds itself steady even in positions that would seem to be highly uncomfortable without fatigue and without pause it can strip an entire tree trunk of its driedup bark the objects of its persevering search are the insects hidden under this bark it can tell by the sound made when it strikes the tree with its beak whether or not the wood is decayed and full of insects a hollow sound being of good omen to the bird if the wood does not give out this hollow sound the woodpecker knows that further drilling at that point would be but so much labor wasted in the first case it strips off the bark makes the wood beneath fly this way and that in a shower of little chips clears off the wormhole dust and finally reaches the plump grub in its snug retreat in the second case it strikes two or three welldirected blows to start the dry bark and frighten any insects that may be lurking underneath immediately this insect population runs in alarm some to the right others to the left toward the opposite side of the tree trunk but the woodpecker knowing well enough what is going on reaches the other side in time to nab the fugitives now said jules i understand what jacques was saying the woodpecker doesnt run around the tree to see whether or not it has bored through to the other side but to gobble up the insects that are trying to get away i thought the woodpecker must be very silly to think it could drill right through the trunk of a tree with one peck of its beak but now that i know the real reason of what it does i see that its a wonderfully clever bird i assure you once more that animals have more intelligence than they are given credit for let us beware of seeing an evil meaning in habits and aptitudes that we do not understand is it not said of the buzzard that it is a stupid bird just because it shows such patience in watching and waiting perfectly motionless for the fieldmouse it suspects to be lurking under the ground and here we have the woodpecker accused of being so foolish as to think it can pierce a tree trunk with one blow of its beak merely because it runs around to capture the insects fleeing to the other side bear this in mind there is in animals no foolishness except what we ascribe to them from our own point of view whenever we are able to discover the real motive we always find their actions perfectly logical and that is only what might have been expected for an animal has no choice in its acts but is made to perform them according to its mode of life as determined from the beginning by divine wisdom man alone is free by a sublime privilege he is left to choose between good and evil between sound reason and blind passion he seeks and chooses at his own risk and peril the true or the false the just or the unjust the beautiful or the ugly but animals having no spiritual battles to fight as we have are now what they have always been and always will be they do today what they did yesterday and will do tomorrow for centuries and centuries they go on doing the same thing without improvement or deterioration and with an unfailing sense given them by god woodpeckers spend their lives running around tree trunks from top to bottom in order to start the old bark that shelters insects and exploring all fissures with their long pointed tongue which is pushed down into every hole where worms may possibly be hiding these birds are placed in our forests as keepers they inspect sickly trees in particular trees honeycombed by vermin and they examine carefully the diseased parts occasionally they may chance to attack a healthy part especially in making their nests and they may thus injure the tree by drilling into the live wood but this damage is more than atoned for in the long run and so i do not hesitate to bestow upon our woodpeckers the title of forestpreservers a title earned by their assiduous warfare on insects injurious to wood seldom do they leave their timberyardthe trunk and the main branches of the treeand descend to the ground except when they chance to find an anthill the inmates of which they devour with delight they place their nests at a considerable height from the ground deep down in a round hole bored with the beak in the heart of some tree trunk the bedding consists of moss and wool and the eggs four to six in number are in every instance white smooth and as lustrous as ivory more about woodpeckers the commonest of our woodpeckers is the green woodpecker which is about as large as a turtledove its plumage has a richness rarely seen in that of any of our other birds the top of the head and the nape of the neck are of a magnificent crimson two mustaches of the same hue adorn the birds face the back is green the breast and stomach yellowish white the rump yellow and the large wingfeathers black with regular marks of white on the edge the female has less brilliant coloring than the male and its mustaches are black instead of red it is the green woodpecker that you heard in the grove this morning giving its cry of teo teo teo i will not go over what jacques has already told you about its different cries the green woodpecker is passionately fond of ants and when it discovers an anthill it posts itself near by and stretches its long viscous tongue across the path the ants follow you know these little creatures way of marching in long files one or more following the exact path taken by the leaders the woodpeckers viscous tongue is extended across this line of march the ants from behind come up hesitate a moment before the barricade and then venture upon the tongue in order to follow their friends marching on ahead as if nothing had happened immediately we have one ant caught then four then ten all struggling in the sticky mucilage covering the tongue the woodpecker does not move but remains quiet until its tongue is quite covered nor has it long to wait soon the living trap laden with game is withdrawn into the beak ah that was a luscious mouthful without leaving the spot the anteater repeats this performance again and again laying its tongue on the ground and then drawing it in black with ants until its hunger is satisfied animals know more than one would think as you said a while ago emile remarked that trick of the woodpeckers shows it plainly enough instead of picking the ants up one by one which would be very slow work with such small game the woodpecker takes them dozens at a time it lays its tongue across their path on the ground draws it in again when it is all plastered over with ants and the thing is done and the mouthful is well worth the trouble who would have thought of making a trap of ones tongue a trap that catches game with glue but its passion for ants resumed uncle paul does not make the woodpecker neglect its duty as keeper of forests it goes climbing up tree trunks tapping the sickly parts and pecking away with blows that at a distance sound like hammer strokes if a passerby interrupts it at its work it does not immediately fly away but runs around the trunk like a squirrel and from the other side sticks out its head a little to see who or what is coming if the intruder advances the woodpecker goes on around the tree always keeping on the opposite side until it becomes frightened when it flies off making the woods ring with its sonorous tiackackan tiackackan it flies with swift darts and bounds swooping down then rising describing a series of undulating arches in the air for its nest it bores out a deep hole in softwood trees such as firs and poplars male and female work with lusty blows of the beak taking turns at the hardest part of the task the piercing of the live wood of the trunk until the wormeaten center is reached chips wooddust and decayed fragments are dug out with the feet and at last the hole is deep enough and slanting enough to exclude the light of day the young ones leave the nest before they can fly and they may be seen exercising near it learning to climb to run around the trunk of their tree and to cling to it upside down you will be amused to watch them if you ever have the good fortune to be present at the frolics of a young family of woodpeckers the great spotted woodpecker is about as large as a thrush it has a wide red stripe across the nape of the neck the upper part of the body is prettily spotted with pure white and deep black and the under part is white as far as the abdomen which is red as is also the rump the female has no red on the nape of the neck the food of this bird is the same as the green woodpeckers it strikes the tree with quicker smarter blows and if disturbed in its work it remains motionless in the shelter of a large branch with its green eyes fixed on the object of its distrust its cry is a kind of hoarse grinding trerrerrerrer the variegated woodpecker much resembles the great spotted woodpecker in plumage but is a little smaller it is adorned with a red cap which covers the whole of the upper part and the back of the head while the great spotted woodpecker has only a stripe of this color on the nape of the neck both these birds are found in the large wooded districts of france and they live on the same dietinsects woodboring larvæ and ants also because of their velvet costume of black and white and their scarlet cap they are both to be ranked among the prettiest birds we have let us add to them the little spotted woodpecker it is smaller than a sparrow and its dress is that of the great spotted woodpecker this bird is found almost exclusively in the fir forests of the east and of the pyrenees the wryneck is closely akin to the woodpeckers in the structure of its feet whose four toes or talons are divided into two pairs one pointing forward and the other backward and in its very long and viscous tongue which it pushes into anthills or stretches out on the ground to receive the insects as they pass it is a small bird being no larger than a lark its plumage is watered with black brown gray and russet somewhat like the woodcocks but with tints better defined and more beautiful in their combined effect the wryneck is a great eater of caterpillars and it is also passionately fond of ants which it catches as does the woodpecker with its sticky tongue laid on the ground across their path its name comes from the habit it has of twisting its neck and looking backward with a sort of slow and undulating movement like a snakes why does it imitate a snake like that emile inquired it is its way of expressing surprise and alarm and perhaps it also hopes to frighten its foe with the motions at any rate it is sometimes successful if a birdnesthunter climbs up to its hole to steal its little ones the wryneck emits from the depths of its retreat a sharp hissing and begins to make snakelike movements with its neck the young birds still featherless imitate their mother to the best of their ability and succeed so well that the hunter thinks he has thrust his hand into a nest of writhing and twisting flatheaded vipers thoroughly frightened the boy clambers down not without leaving some shreds of his breeches on the way serves the rascal right too declared emile the wryneck reaches us in april and leaves toward the end of summer it haunts the outskirts of woods and visits gardens and orchards for caterpillars it nests in a hole in a tree trunk and gladly avails itself of the woodpeckers abandoned quarters after furbishing them up a little to suit itself the eggs which are white and polished like the woodpeckers rest on a simple little bed of wooddust that the bird dislodges from the walls of its hole with a few blows of its beak despite the structure of its feet the wryneck does not climb tree trunks and rarely even perches on them preferring to stay on the ground and hunt caterpillars or stretch out its tongue in the ants path which has given it in the south the name of stretchtongue the nuthatch on the contrary though differing from the woodpecker in the formation of its claws is a firstrate climber and spends its life running about on the trunks of trees inspecting every crack and cranny for insects and pecking at the old bark three of its talons point forward the fourth alone being turned in the opposite direction but for firmness of support the last is worth two of the others so thick and powerful is it and the nail at the end so strong and hooked the beak resembles the woodpeckers being straight fluted lengthwise and sharply pointed it is an excellent tool for digging into wood and getting out the worms the tongue cannot be projected like the woodpeckers to catch insects with its glue nor does the tail serve as a support the nuthatch examines old trees with painstaking care going up and down the trunk repeatedly or around it in a spiral and sometimes visiting a branch above or below or on one side every crack is explored with the point of the beak to the accompaniment of the birds resonant cry tuee tuee tuee repeated again and again in a penetrating tone very few insects can escape so careful a search if grubs are lacking the nuthatch makes a frugal meal of a hazelnut first it fixes the nut firmly in the fork made by two branches and then it hammers away at it encouraging itself the while by uttering its cry until the hard shell is pierced and the kernel exposed it must take the bird a long time to crack a hazelnut with its beak was the opinion of jules no it is done very quickly the beak is so hard and pointed very quickly too a caged nuthatch will break through the woodwork of its prison and make an opening large enough to escape through not even the woodpecker has a better carpenters chisel the nuthatch is about as large as a sparrow all the upper part of its plumage is of a bluish ash color the throat and cheeks are white and the breast and stomach red a black stripe starting from the corner of the beak passes over the eye and down the side of the neck this bird nests in a hole in a tree trunk and it knows how if need be to make the opening of the nest smaller with a little moistened clay its eggs from five to seven in number are laid on moss or wooddust and are of a dingy white dotted with red it gets its name of nuthatch which means nuthacker from its way of hacking the nuts it is so fond of climbersthe hoopoe i have been telling you about woodpeckers and the nuthatch insecteaters with chiselshaped beaks for cutting into trees and getting out the worms hidden in the wood then i spoke of the wryneck which does not use its beak for hacking old tree trunks but can like the woodpecker stick out its tongue on the ants path and catch the insects with the glue of its saliva now we come to some more insecteaters but their work is less laborious than that of the woodpecker they do not hack and hew tree trunks but merely seek their prey in the cracks and crannies that serve as its refuge for this kind of hunting they have a long and slender beak that curves slightly downward as their name implies climbers show great agility in climbing their beak is very narrow the better to penetrate the cracks in the bark of trees and it is bent like an arch and has a fine point their feet have three talons pointing forward and one much stronger pointing backward we have in france two climbers one of which is furnished with a tail composed of a few long stiff feathers that serve as a support to the bird in climbing as the woodpeckers tail serves that bird while the other is not thus equipped the socalled common climber is a tiny bird with whitish plumage spotted with brown above and tinged with red on the rump and tail its life is a most laborious one it frequents woods orchards and the trees of our public promenades where you may see it always busily engaged in examining every square inch of the surface of tree trunks in order to thrust its slender beak into the cracks of the bark and catch any lurking gnats bugs caterpillars or cocoons it runs down the trunk as fast as it runs up which woodpeckers cannot do their progress always being upward either in a straight line or spirally it ascends in little leaps and bounds and helps itself along by propping its tail against the tree arrived at the top of the trunk it descends quickly and begins the same operations on the next tree at every step it cheers itself up with its sharp flutelike cry at nightfall it retires into some hole in a tree trunk there too it makes its nest which is formed of fine grasses and bits of moss held together by threads from spiders webs its eggs from five to seven in number are pure white with red spots the wallclimber or scaler makes its way up the perpendicular faces of rocks ramparts and old walls prying out all the various insects and their eggs that may be lurking in the fissures with its large claws it clings to these vertical surfaces and does not use its tail as a support this bird which is of about the size of a lark has unusually beautiful plumage of a light ash color with touches of bright red black and pure white on the wings the throat is black and so is the tail the latter being edged with white at the tip the richness of its coloring and the habit it has of remaining stationary in its flight before the rock or other surface it is exploring just as butterflies hold themselves motionless on their wings while they suck the honey of flowers with their trumpet have given it the expressive name of butterfly of the rocks it inhabits the alps the pyrenees and the jura mountains in winter it visits old buildings in our towns the hoopoe is especially remarkable for its double row of long red feathers edged with black and white which at the birds pleasure are made to lie down toward the back or stand upright on the head and spread out as a handsome crest the rest of the plumage is winecolored except the tail and wings which are black the wings are also ornamented with white stripes running across them in size this bird is about as large as a turtledove it lives alone and prefers to remain on the ground usually rarely perching unless on the lower branches of trees its favorite haunts are moist fields which it walks over at a sedate pace every now and then erecting its beautiful crest either from satisfaction at having found a savory mouthful or because of being startled by something for it is a very timid bird with its long beak it digs in the ground for grubs beetles and crickets or it gathers ants on its viscous tongue when it has had enough it withdraws to some low branch and there digests its food at leisure at the mating season it says poo poo whence without doubt comes its familiar nickname of poopoo elegant though it is in appearance the hoopoe is not at all particular about the condition of its nest which it makes in the interior of a wormeaten tree trunk it lines the hole with a mortar composed of clay and cows dung whereon it places a little bed of dry leaves and moss this nest so deep and so hard to keep clean ought to be cleared out daily but the parent bird does nothing about it leaving the filth to accumulate until it forms a rampart all around the nest this barricade may serve as an excellent defense against the birdnesthunter who would naturally hesitate to thrust his hand into the foul mess and so i will not censure the bird too severely for its poor housekeeping the hoopoe is with us only in summer toward the first of september it crosses the mediterranean to pass the winter under the warmer skies of africa the cuckoo in an old peartree with dense foliage at the foot of the garden a blackheaded warbler had built its nest day by day jules had watched the bird as it brought blades of dry grass one by one and wove them into the shape of a cup after which it furnished the interior with a hair mattress then came the eggs to the number of five light chestnut in color marbled with darker streaks parting the branches very gently in the mothers absence and standing on tiptoe jules had peeped into the nest but of course without touching anything he had merely cast a rapid glance at the pretty cluster of five eggs lying together at the bottom the laying was over his uncle told him now would begin the incubation and in a few days five little creatures blind and featherless would at the slightest rustling of the foliage stretch their yellow beaks wide open in mute appeal for food already jules was looking forward to the good time he would have in watching from a distance the bringing up of the brood and was planning how when the little birds should have grown a trifle larger he would put some small caterpillars and worms on the end of a stick and drop them into the nest for the young ones to eat then before long the newfledged warblers would leave the nest and the garden would have five more caterpillardestroyers repaying with their services and joyful songs the kindhearted attentions of their boy friend that was what jules was eagerly looking forward to yesterday but today he returns from his visit to the nest with a troubled look on his face a strange thing has happened with the warblers five eggs there is a sixth one a little larger and of a different color whence comes this strange egg who put it in the nest and why uncle paul on being consulted went to the nest and came back with the egg your warblers nest my dear child he said has had a fortunate escape but for your visit this morning the young birds would have been lost almost as soon as they were hatched this egg that i have brought back is a cuckoos egg but i dont see how it came to be in the warblers nest or what danger it threatened to the young birds that are coming you will see when i tell you the cuckoos habits it is a curious story the cuckoo is the bird that in early spring when the meadows are sprinkled with violets and the trees are just putting forth their leaves keeps repeating its cry of cuckoo cuckoo in a clear and plaintive tone i have often heard it said jules singing on the edges of woods but have never been able to get a good look at it i have seen it flying away emile put in and it seemed to me pretty large the cuckoo is at least as large as a turtledove their uncle continued its plumage is ashy gray on the back and white underneath with numerous brown crosswise stripes resembling those seen on many birds of prey the wings are long as is also the tail which is spotted and tipped with white despite its likeness to the goshawk and sparrowhawk the cuckoo is not to be classed as a bird of prey its talons lack the necessary strength and its beak which is rather long is flattened and only slightly curved those are neither the hooked claws nor the savage beak of a bird living the life of a murderer the cuckoos food consists entirely of insects and caterpillars you remember the processionaries of the oak tree those frightful black caterpillars that spin large silken nests against the trunk of a tree and bristle with barbed hairs that cause such terrible itching if you touch them yes answered jules and you told us that the cuckoo eats those caterpillars it feasts on them as it does on all hairy caterpillars but the hairs are rolled up into a ball in the stomach and thrown up through the beak as a greedy devourer of insects and caterpillars the cuckoo deserves protection the only regret is that a multitude of little birds most useful to us should be destroyed by it let us consider the facts of the case the female cuckoo never builds a nest nor does she know how to hatch out her own young but let us plead the best excuse we can for her her breast seems to be so formed as not to impart enough warmth to eggs to make them hatch and more than that she lays so often throughout the summer as to leave her no time for making a home of her own in short this bird never knows the joy of taking care of her young it is not because she will not hatch her own eggs but because she cannot she has to leave this work to other birds then the cuckoos egg i found in the garden nest was left there for the warbler to take care of jules inquired precisely now see by what wonderful planning the strange egg comes to be adopted by another mother bear in mind that the cuckoo lives exclusively on insects the young cuckoo must have caterpillars where will food of this sort be found if not in the nests of birds that feed on insects as for instance warblers redbreasts tomtits nightingales stonechats wagtails and others it is to just these nests that the cuckoo goes sometimes it may chance to lay its eggs in the nests of birds that live on seeds such as linnets bullfinches greenfinches or yellowhammers but even then the choice is wise for if the fosterparents are eaters of seeds they bring up their young on worms which are easier to digest and so the little cuckoo finds in these nests food suited to its needs but the cuckoos eggs are never laid in the nests of quails partridges or other species whose young are granivorous from the beginning in a brood whose habitual diet was not theirs the changelings would surely die of hunger but how asked jules does the cuckoo know what nests to choose and what ones not to choose when it lays its eggs if it knew why it laid its eggs where it does i should have to admit that the cuckoos sagacity surpassed mans but it does not know at all the reason for its choice a wise providence has arranged everything for the bird the eggwhich judged by the cuckoos size should be as large as a pigeons or a turtledovesis hardly as big as a sparrows so that it can easily find a place in the warblers or even the wrens tiny nest without arousing the adoptive mothers suspicions moreover this egg is variable in its color as if the better to harmonize with the coloring of those with which it will be incubated whether in this or that or the other nest sometimes the cuckoos egg is ashcolored at other times red green or pale blue it may closely resemble the sparrows eggs or it may be mottled with spots of smaller or larger size in lesser or greater numbers or again it may be marbled with black streaks but despite these variations it is always easy to see the difference between the cuckoos egg and the others in a nest if one of the eggs is found to differ from the others in shape and color that one certainly came from the cuckoo by that sign alone i recognized the egg we have here from the warblers nest the other five jules declared are as like one another as so many drops of water but the sixth which you have there is very different and that is why i am sure it belongs to the cuckoo replied his uncle the cuckoo seems to me said louis very large to be able to get into such a small nest as the warblers the redbreasts or the nightingales so as to lay its egg there that is not what the bird does the egg is laid on the ground anywhere then the mother takes it up in her beak puts it in a sort of pocket at the base of her gulleta pocket provided for that purposeand flies through the neighboring thickets on the lookout for a place for its final reception when she finds a nest to suit her she stretches her neck over the edge opens her beak and lets the egg gently drop among the others that done the cuckoo flies away and never returns to learn the result other eggs are placed in the same way here and there one by one in different nests and do the owners of the nests make no objections asked jules if they are at home they receive the cuckoo with angry pecks and chase her away but she usually succeeds in choosing the right moment and approaches the nest by stealth when the owners are absent but when they come back they must see at least that there is a strange egg in the nest and throw it out not at all whether or not the mother bird perceives that there is an egg too many i could not say but at any rate as there must be cuckoos in the world things are so arranged that their species shall not become extinct and all the eggs in the nest are watched over and hatched with impartial care until the last young bird is out at first all goes well enough the young ones need but little food and for one more the parents can easily find enough worms all are fed alike with no more for the children of the house than for the stranger but pretty soon the young cuckoo is found to be growing faster than the others it will soon need for itself alone all the food that its fosterparents can possibly secure with the utmost industry it is always opening its wide beak always complaining of hunger moreover it is cramped for room in the little house of hair and wool its featherless body squatting there flat and red its large head its bottomless abyss of a beak its big bulging eyes all give it the appearance of a toad sitting at the bottom of the nest there is no longer room in the house for all its inmates nor yet enough food to live on then a dreadful deed is done the young cuckoo slips under one of the little birds takes it on its back which is hollowed as if for the purpose and holds it there by slightly raising its wings dragging itself backward to the raised rim of the nest it rests a moment and then throws the burden over the horrid creature throws out of the nest the little one of the bird that feeds it exclaimed emile incredulously yes in cold blood so as to have more room for itself with the tips of its wings it feels around for a moment to make sure the little bird is gone and then returns to the bottom of the nest to go through the same process with another and so they all go one after another to the very last all are thrown out of the nest id like to be there to catch him at itthe scoundrel was emiles comment what becomes of the poor little things pushed out of their own home by the ungrateful young cuckoo if the nest is high above the ground all perish crushed by their fall and the ants immediately begin to suck their blood if it is low some live and take refuge in the moss where the mother comes to console them and bring them something to eat the cuckoo remains in sole possession of the nest and the horrid toad will starve to death there said jules the father and mother now that their brood is destroyed wont bring it anything more to eat that is where you are mistaken they continue to feed it liberally as if nothing had happened they perform wonders to satisfy its big appetite they do not allow themselves a minutes rest in their efforts to fill that beak that is always open and is wide enough to swallow the nurses themselves then the warbler isnt afraid of her greedy nursling that might gobble her up any moment queried jules although she is its mother only by chance she is devoted to it she comes joyfully with a caterpillar at the end of her beak while the cuckoo gapes at the edge of the nest as ugly as a little monster with no tremor of fear the warbler delivers the mouthful by putting her head into the yawning gulf the gulf closes swallows and yawns again demanding something more and all haste is made to satisfy its needs kind warbler murmured jules what selfdenial in order to bring up the ugly rascal that has ravaged her nest so it has to be uncle paul rejoined or we should long ago have been left with no cuckoos in the world to help us get rid of the processionary caterpillars of the oaktree all the same i dont like that bird and with this jules took up the cuckoos egg he had found in the garden nest may i said he to his uncle with a gesture yes i have no objection answered uncle paul who preferred five warblers in his garden to one vagabond cuckoo and smack went the egg as the boy dashed it to the ground shrikes all sorts of absurd stories have been made up about the cuckoo and its curious habits and thus fable has added to the actual facts which are in themselves strange enough even today there are in circulation any number of fairy tales on the subject of this bird i will tell you a few of them in order to put you on your guard against these childish notions first they say cuckoos change their nature twice a year being cuckoos in the spring and sparrowhawks the rest of the year according to this account the bird comes to us from some distant country in april in its first form on the back of a kite that is so accommodating as to serve it as a mount this mode of travel is adopted by the cuckoo to spare its own wings still too weak to carry it undoubtedly the birds plumagewhich as i have told you resembles in its brown crosswise stripes on the breast the plumage of certain birds of preyhas fostered this popular belief in the changing of the cuckoo into a sparrowhawk and of the sparrowhawk into a cuckoo people have allowed themselves to be deceived by this variegated dress when the bird sings in april and may it is a cuckoo because it has the cuckoos cry but when it falls silent in summer it becomes a sparrowhawk because it has the plumage of one so the cuckoo is changed into a sparrowhawk and when spring comes again the sparrowhawk is changed into a cuckoo once more for thousands and thousands of years this nonsense has been believed by most people the cuckoo is a migratory bird it remains with us from april to september but departs for africa at the approach of winter to explain its reappearance in the spring some one invented the story of its being carried on the back of a kite but i need not assure you that there is not a word of truth in this fairy tale the cuckoo is always a cuckoo and it returns from warmer climes on its own wings as does the swallow another legend is that the cuckoo turns into a toad isnt that because the cuckoo when it is young and before it has any feathers is very ugly and looks like a toad asked jules exactly and finally the bird is accused of discharging on plants a fatal saliva that breeds insects the truth of the matter is that a tiny insect light green and shaped somewhat like a grasshopper is in the habit of pricking the stems of plants with its sucker to make the sap run and this sap presents the appearance of a white foam that looks like saliva the insect takes its position in the midst of this cool and foamy froth to shelter itself from the heat of the sun and to drink at its leisure there you have the real facts in the case cuckoospit is the name popularly given to the insect it does little harm to plants in reality then the supposed harmful saliva of the cuckoo is merely an ingenious means employed by an inoffensive little creature to keep itself cool many other ridiculous stories are told about the cuckoo but it would be only a waste of time to dwell on them let us get on we have already had occasion several times to speak of our doubtful helpers those coworkers whose valuable services are offset by certain grave offenses you have just seen how that devourer of hairy caterpillars the cuckoo is guilty of the blackest ingratitude toward the warbler its nurse in brutally throwing out of their nest the little birds which would have become model caterpillardestroyers that is a rather high price to pay for the destruction of oaktree processionary caterpillars to finish the list of these birds whose conduct deserves from an agricultural point of view both praise and blame i will tell you about the shrike a great insectdestroyer but also a barbarous slaughterer of small birds despite their diminutive sizethe largest shrike being hardly as big as a thrushthese birds have the fierce boldness of the most powerful birds of prey they will even pursue any falcon that ventures near their nest their diet consists chiefly of large insects but unfortunately they also pounce on little birds greedily devouring their brains and afterward tearing their flesh to shreds and eating it too for this life of rapine they have a strong hooked beak toothed toward the tip of the upper mandible and powerful talons ending in sharp nails that resemble in miniature the claws of birds of prey we have in this country four species of shrikes the common shrike is of the size of a blackbird and its plumage is ashy gray above and white underneath a wide black stripe starting from the beak continues around the eye and runs down over the cheek the wings and tail are black ornamented with white the bird likes to perch on lofty treetops where it keeps repeating its cry of truee truee in a piercing tone in flying from tree to tree it looks as if it were going to alight on the ground but presently it rises again describing a graceful curve in the air its food consists chiefly of fieldmice and large beetles but occasionally of small birds which it catches on the wing it likes to build its nest in tangled and thorny hedges and lays from four to six eggs reddish in color and encircled toward the large end by a ring of brown spots similar rings are found placed in the same way on the eggs of our various other shrikes and furnish a distinctive and easily recognizable characteristic mark the blackheaded shrike can be recognized as its name indicates by the wide black stripe that encircles the forehead this bird is of about the larks size and has the plumage of the common shrike except on the stomach which is reddish the eggs white tinted with red have the ring at the large end formed of numerous little spots red brown or violet in color the red shrike is slightly smaller the top of its head and the back of its neck are bright red the stomach and rump white otherwise the plumage is like that of the two species just described the redbacked shrike is the smallest and the bestknown of our shrikes it is ash color on the head and rump chestnut red on the back and light red underneath a black ring encircles the eye the throat is white and the large tailfeathers and wingfeathers are black these last three shrikes that i have named can at will imitate the various cries of small birds and they make use of this talent it is said to lure them to their destruction the redbacked shrike is especially expert in this it first hides in some dense shrubbery and then imitates the song of whatever species it hears chirping in the neighborhood the imprudent ones come at its call which they think proceeds from one of their own kind and the redbacked shrike pounces on them as soon as it has them well within reach but this trick succeeds only with inexperienced little birds the older ones knowing it and taking care not to be deceived the captured bird is skinned before being eaten and that is the origin of the french name écorcheur flayer given to this fourth species of shrike the others however share this habit as they lack the faculty of rolling the feathers into a ball and throwing them up after digestion as do the hornless owls these birds take the precaution to prepare the game beforehand by tearing off the skin in shreds it is a quick way of plucking their victim notwithstanding its talent in imitating the calls of other birds the redbacked shrike is not so lucky as to make dupes every day in case of failure the shrike contents itself with common mice fieldmice grasshoppers junebugs and fat beetles such is the shrikes passion for beetles that when it has eaten all it can it continues to hunt them just for the fun of hunting and not knowing what to do with the captured insects it impales them on the thorns of bushes perhaps that is its way of stocking its larder with food and letting it acquire a strong flavor like venison a flavor much to its taste the other shrikes also have this mania for laying up reserves of beetles stuck on thorns reserves which the bird does not always come back for and which often dry up on the spot without being touched but this waste of game is of little consequence as the final result is always to our advantage we are delivered from a multitude of foes by these eager hunters when they do us such service shall we count it an unpardonable crime that they sometimes allow themselves the pleasure of feasting on little birds for my part i should be very reluctant to do so i pity with all my heart the poor little bird that foolishly lets itself be caught by the shrike but i also have a lively sympathy for the beautiful tree which if bereft of its defenders would soon be given over to the worms and honeycombed with holes all packed with filth the redbacked shrike frequents groves orchards and gardens it nests in thick hedges sometimes in the interlacing branches of appletrees its eggs are white tinged with red the ring at the large end is composed of brown gray and greenish spots in building its nest the bird uses a kind of everlasting that grows abundantly in the fields and has stems all covered with a white cottonlike fluff the inside of the nest is furnished with a couch of little twigs and fine rootlets interwoven and comfortably overlaid with wool down and horsehair the other shrikes use in their nests the same materials especially the everlasting with its white fluff the titmouse at last we come to some caterpillardestroyers that are never anything but helpful first of all there is the titmouse also known as the tomtit it is a graceful little bird lively and quicktempered always on the go flying continually from tree to tree carefully inspecting the branches hanging from the tip ends of the slenderest of them in all sorts of positions often head downward swaying this way and that with its flexible support and never letting go its hold while it examines all buds that it suspects of containing worms and tears these buds to pieces in order to get at the grubs and insect eggs they contain it is calculated that a titmouse consumes three hundred thousand insect eggs a year and certainly few birds have larger families to provide for twenty or more little ones all huddled together in the same nest are not too great a strain on the parents energy and industry the mother bird has to examine buds and the fissures in the bark of trees in order to find grubs spiders caterpillars worms of every kind and feed a score of beaks always open and demanding food in the bottom of the nest she comes with a caterpillar the brood is all excitement twenty mouths fly open but only one receives the morsel leaving nineteen still expectant then away flies the titmouse again without an instants pause to seek more food thus back and forth she flies without rest and without weariness and by the time the twentieth mouth is fed the first one is again open and has been open a good while clamoring for more i will leave you to guess how many worms are eaten in a day by such a household and i will also let you reach your own conclusions regarding the value of these birds as caterpillarhunters among our fruittrees complaint is made i know that they tear open the buds and destroy them but the harm they do is only apparent when they pluck a bud it is to get out some tiny larva lodged between two scales and not to harm the young leaves or flowers that are forming it is better that this wormy bud should perish it would not have produced anything and the enemy lodged within it would have produced countless others to ravage the tree the next year then the titmouse does not feed on vegetable matter asked louis no except perhaps occasionally on a few seeds such as those of hemp the bird requires animal food small insects of all kinds their eggs and larvæ suit it best its appetite for prey is so keen that it has the courage to attack little disabled birds or those caught in snares pecking at their skulls and greedily devouring their brains it is true that the titmouse is remarkably courageous despite its smallness of size it is extremely quick and quarrelsome and a regular little ogre in time of famine its beak is conical strong short and pointed and its claws end in hooked nails designed for seizing their victims like the talons of birds of prey with these the bird grasps its food and conveys it to its beak like the parrot at the end of the brooding season the tomtits all assemble in companies of one or two families each and travel together by short stages these companies appear to have a leader probably the father or the mother and every now and then they are called together from one tree to another after which they separate again only to reunite once more at the leaders summons their flight is short and irregular they scatter through the woods gardens fields and orchards inspecting trees and bushes on the way and picking up larvæ and insects the titmouse family is made up of many species we have eight in our country but i shall speak only of the principal ones the coaltit is the largest being of about the redbreasts size it is bluish gray on the back and yellow underneath the head is of a beautiful glossy black and a wide stripe of the same color runs down the middle of the chest and stomach and around the eyes which are also set off by a large white spot the large wingfeathers are edged with ashy blue this bird is very common in copses and gardens and is the one we hear in autumn repeating as it examines the bark of fruittrees its cry of titipoo titipoo titipoo at times this cry has a harsh sound like the rasping of a file and this has given to the bird in some neighborhoods the name of locksmith it nests in a hollow tree trunk lining its quarters with some soft silky material chiefly fine feathers its laying consists of about fifteen white eggs spotted with light red especially toward the large end its family demands not fewer than three hundred caterpillars a day or their equivalent in vermin of some sort what the gardener the nurseryman and the forester owe this valiant caterpillardestroyer by the end of the year cannot be calculated yet i have seen these very persons angrily thrust an arm into the hollow trunk of an old appletree to pull out the coaltits nest and throw the whole thing to the windseggs feathers and little birds only a day old and they thought they were doing something worthy of praise for according to them the coaltit eats buds but i declare that the coaltit does not eat buds it eats the little larvæ lodged in the buds scales and its instinct never allows it to molest healthy buds which contain nothing of any value to the bird leave it in peace then to pluck the wormy buds which it can very easily tell from the sound ones the coaltit sometimes eats hempseed or hazelnuts picking out the edible part with a dexterity of beak and clawi had almost said handpossessed by no other bird the sparrow chaffinch goldfinch and others crush the hempseed between their mandibles the coaltit grasps it in its claw carries it to the beak and makes in the shell a small round opening through which it picks out the meat the hazelnut is managed with the same skill the blue tit is a beautiful little bird that keeps company with the coaltit and frequents orchards it is olivecolored above and yellow underneath with the top of the head an azure blue the forehead white and the cheeks white framed in black a little collar of black also encircles the back and sides of the neck the large feathers of the tail and wings are edged with blue this titmouse so elegant in plumage so graceful in its bearing always running about over the bark of tree trunks and around the branches always hanging from the flexible boughs and always pecking and searching is no whit inferior to the coaltit in its talent for catching caterpillars it has been seen in a few hours to clear a rosebush of two thousand plantlice caterpillars and the eggs of insects especially of those that attack fruit are its chief food it is very fond of little birds brains but if need be can get along with hempseed like the coaltit it nests in a hollow tree trunk its nest being nothing but a heap of small feathers no other species raises a larger family the eggs are more than twenty in number white with reddish spots especially at the large end two other tomtits of less value as caterpillardestroyers build their nests with much art they are the longtailed titmouse and the penduline the first of these is different from all other tomtits in the length of its tail which forms more than half the length of the body this bird lives in the woods during the summer and visits our gardens and orchards only in the winter it is a small bird scarcely bigger than a wren reddish gray on the back and white underneath with a tinge of red on the stomach and with white nape and cheeks the nest is occasionally built in the fork of some branch in bush or hedge a few feet from the ground but oftener it is attached to the trunk of a willow or a poplar its shape is that of an elongated oval or rather an enormous cocoon enlarged at the base with an entrance on the side about an inch from the top the outside is made of lichens such as grow on old tree trunks having thus the appearance of bark and deceiving the casual observer filaments of wool bind the whole compactly together the dome or roof ingeniously contrived for shedding rain is a thick felt of moss and cobweb the inside is like an oven with a bowlshaped bottom and high arched top its shape and the thick layer of soft feathers lining it make the nest warm and cozy from sixteen to twenty young birds are packed into the narrow space which does not exceed the hollow of the hand by what miracle of orderly arrangement do these twenty little creatures and their mother manage to find room for themselves in this tiny abode and how can tails of such length develop there it would be impossible to find anywhere a more economical use of space how i should like to see the twenty little tomtits snuggling together in that tiny nest emile exclaimed i have had that good fortune said his uncle and even now i am strangely moved whenever i think of those twenty little heads stretching up from the bottom of the nest trembling and with open beaks as if their mother had come i looked for a moment through the opening of the nest at the tiny creatures and then withdrew the parents were already at hand ruffling their feathers with anxiety fear nothing little birds so watchful of your family uncle paul is not one to commit the crime of touching your nest nor emile either chimed in the boy nor yet jules or louis added the lastnamed i hope not indeed for otherwise uncle paul would tell you no more stories the pendulines nest is still more remarkable this titmouse is found hardly anywhere except along the banks of the lower rhone it hangs its nest very high from the tip of some swaying tree branch by the waterside so that its young are gently rocked by the breeze from the water the nest is a sort of oval purse about as large as a quart bottle and pierced on the side near the top by a narrow opening that would hardly admit a mans thumb to enter its nest the tomtit small though it is must stretch the elastic wall which yields a little and then contracts again this purseshaped abode is made of the cottonlike fluff that flies off in may from the ripe catkins of poplars and willows the bird gathers this material and then weaves it together with a warp of wool and hemp the resulting fabric resembles the felt of a coarse hat i am at a loss to understand how the bird manages to weave with its beak and claws a stuff superior to any that the unaided human fingers could produce and yet it does this with no instruction with no hesitation and with no hints from the work of others at its very first attempt the titmouse puts to shame the studied art of our weavers and fullers the top or roof of the nest includes in its structure the tip of the branch from which it hangs and also the little twigs growing out of that tip end which serve as a framework for the vault but the foliage emerges from the sides of the nest and furnishes shade from the suns heat finally to secure the nest more firmly cordage of wool and hemp binds the upper part to the branch and below is worked into the woof of the felt the inside is lined with poplar fluff of the best quality it takes a pair of pendulines three weeks of the hardest work to make this marvel doesnt the rain ever get through the covering of the nest emile inquired no the felt is so thick and so closely woven that even with the hardest rain not a drop of water can leak into the cottonlined interior how comfortable the little birds must be in their snug nest the wind rocks them gently over the water and from their little window they can see the river flowing below what is this clever penduline like it is ashcolored with brown wings and tail and a black stripe across the forehead its dress is simple you see as is always the case with those that possess real merit the blue tit has rich plumage but when it comes to nestbuilding it can only pile feathers on top of one another at the bottom of a treehollow the penduline is of modest appearance but it builds the most wonderful nest it is possible to find to each his portion talent or fine clothes all of us here choose talent declared jules never my children urged uncle paul be untrue to that sentiment we should have to forget your teachings the other replied before we could do that and what are the eggs like asked emile emile is bound to have all i can tell him about the penduline does this builder of felt nests interest you then so very much yes it does emile assured him well the eggs are quite white and rather long there are three or four of them to a nest no more than that when the other tomtits have twenty no more but to make up for it there are two layings a year the wren and the kinglet another highly talented architect past master in the building of nests is the wren known in learned language as the troglodyte if you ask me the meaning of this strange name i shall reply that it is a greek word signifying dweller in holes some inventor of names more in love with greek than desirous of being understood thought he was doing a fine thing when he gave this big name to the little bird that worms its way into small holes as a mouse would perhaps my description will be more easily understood than his hard name the troglodyte or wren is a fluffy bunch of plumage resembling that of the woodcock with trailing wings beak to windward and tail erect over its rump it is always frisking and hopping about uttering the while its cheery cry of teederee teeree teeree i know that bird jules broke in it isnt much bigger than a walnut and every winter it comes flying about the house hunting in the woodpile and in holes in the walls and darting into the thickest parts of bushes from a distance you would take it for a bold little rat that is it that is the wren in summer it lives in densely grown woods there under the arch formed by some large upwardcurving root coated with a thick fleece of moss it builds a home for itself in imitation of the pendulines nest the materials it uses are bits of moss which make the nest look like its support it forms them into a large hollow ball with a very narrow opening on one side it is lined with feathers occasionally the wren builds its nest in some chimney or a pile of fagots a thick clump of ivy or a natural cavity in the bank of a shady stream the laying consists of about ten white eggs dotted with red at the large end when the weather turns cold the bird leaves the woods and approaches our farmhouses you can see it then always busy and on the move prying into dark holes in woodpiles old walls dead trees and thick bushes looking in every crack and cranny for all kinds of vermin that take up their winter quarters in the fissures with which old bark is furrowed and in the cracks that occur in weatherbeaten mortar to gain an idea of their unceasing activity in this sort of research you have only to watch them once as they go prying into a heap of brush flying in and out on all sides of it without a moments pause for rest yes assented jules but it is so tiny a creature it cant do much work if the wren hunted big game certainly at the end of the day it would not have captured its prey by the dozen what could such a little thing do with a junebug it would not come to the end of such a supply of food for several days and the junebug would be too hard for its beak too remarked jules what it needs is the smallest of caterpillars and the tiniest of gnats which make a more delicate mouthful and are better adapted to the birds small throat i need not remind you that the worst foes to our crops are the smallest a grub too tiny to catch the eye endangers our cereals and others equally small ravage our fruit while it is still in the bud how much does it take to destroy a blossom that would produce a pear the size of your two fists one single larva just visible to the naked eye well the wren attacks these tiny foes of ours that are all the more troublesome because we cannot see them easily now guess how many little caterpillars a day the wren needs for feeding its brood observers whose patience i admire have calculated the number let us say ten caterpillars to each little bird replied jules and ten little birds in the nest that would make a hundred caterpillars a day and it is certainly a lot a lot ah how far out you are in your reckoning the mother wren brings something to her little ones at least thirtysix times an hour she feeds them a mixed diet of insects larvæ and eggs at the end of a day the number of insects destroyed of one kind and another amounts to one hundred and fiftysix thousand that leaves your paltry hundred a long way behind my dear jules then the caterpillars must be very small or the brood of wrens would die of indigestion undoubtedly they are exceedingly small and then a great many are not even hatched yet but the result as far as we are concerned is just as important so many eggs devoured meaning so many ravagers the fewer a little later supposing said louis that the wren takes only the worms that attack pears that would be one hundred and fiftysix thousand pears the little birds would save for us in one day evidently but that is beyond belief i admit that the result is very great in comparison with the means employed a tiny bird that nobody notices goes pecking here and there and we find that at the end of the day the caterpillareater has destroyed either in the egg or in the nymphstage or in the final form thousands of insects which if allowed to live would have deprived us of enormous basketfuls of fruit and hundreds of bushels of grain if we were to estimate the value of the crops saved by insectivorous birds it would be a fabulous sum leave them therefore in peace my children and do all you can to protect them for these busy little creatures ward off famine from our homes while we are on the subject let us speak of another little tom thumb of a bird another caterpillardestroyer as energetic as the wren it is called the kinglet that is to say the little king on account of the crown of golden yellow edged with black that encircles its head it is the smallest of our birds it is olivecolored above and yellowishwhite beneath its beautiful crown feathers can stand up like a crest the kinglet breeds in the cold countries of europe and especially in the fir forests of norway its nest is a little ball no bigger than your fist open at the top artistically fashioned outside with moss wool and spiders webs and lined with the softest down it rests flat on some fir branch at an inaccessible height the eggs from six to eight in number are of a uniform flesh color although very delicate in appearance the kinglet stands the cold with great hardihood it comes to us from the land of its birth in small flocks when the autumnal fogs are gathering and the leaves are falling these flocks of five or six birds at most scatter through the woods public promenades and orchards to examine the cracks in bark to explore the heaps of dead leaves and to inspect the buds while clinging to the tips of the smallest branches not even the tomtit shows itself a more expert gymnast in hanging with head downward and working in all sorts of attitudes the task of destroying caterpillars is accompanied by a continual little rallying cry zeezeezee zeezeezee the kinglet has great confidence in mankind with no sign of fear even when within hearing of the footsteps and conversation of persons walking about it continues its evolutions its hunting its zeezeezee it will let one come close almost near enough to reach out a hand and take hold of it but the knowing little creature although it appears not to see you because it is so busy darts suddenly away and mounts to the upper branches to carry on its work at a safer distance swallows we have whole tribes of helpers that devote themselves to the patient search for insect eggs in the cracks of tree bark and in piles of dead leaves for larvæ between the scales of buds and in the wormholes in wood and for insects lurking in narrow crevices where they hide from their pursuers these invaluable assistants of ours embrace the magpies nuthatches wrynecks climbers tomtits wrens kinglets and many others in the kind of hunting here referred to the bird is not obliged to chase the game to vie with it in swiftness it is enough to know how to find it in its hidingplace for this a sharp eye and a slender beak are necessary wings are only of secondary importance but now we come to other species of birds that hunt in the air chase their game on the wing pursuing gnats and flies and butterflies moths and mosquitoes and beetles they require a short beak but one that opens very wide and is pretty sure to catch insects as they flya beak in fine that may be depended on to work almost of itself and without an instants pause in the birds flight a beak that above all is so sticky inside that as soon as an insects wing grazes this viscous lining it is caught fast in the gluelike substance the beak of the bat that other hunter of insects on the wing the bats beak i say opening from ear to ear may serve as a model in respect to the width of its opening but above all else the hunter must have swift wings that never tire that can fly as fast as the prey which is trying so hard to escape that can follow the bewildering zigzags of a moth manœuvering to save its life a cleft beak that opens wide and wings that are strong and tirelesssuch must be the equipment of the bird that pursues its prey in the open air chief among these hunters is the swallow which may be called the daylight bat as the bat is the twilight swallow both chase flying insects following them in their endless dodgings and doublings and snapping them up with yawning beak then passing on without an instants delay to the pursuit of others but how much more pleasing in appearance how much swifter in flight is the swallow than that hunter the sadlooking bat while we may compare their work and their way of hunting we cannot compare them in anything else buffon quotes guéneau de montbéliard as saying the air is the swallows appropriate element and it is the nature of the bird to be ever on the wing it eats flying bathes flying and sometimes even feeds its young when flying it glides through the air with no effort with perfect ease conscious of being in its own domain it explores aërial space in all its dimensions as if to enjoy it to the utmost and its delight in the act is expressed by little cries of rapture it may be seen giving chase to flying insects and following with supple agility their evasive and tortuous course or it may leave one to pursue another and snap up a third in passing or again it lightly skims the surface of land and water to catch any that may be gathered there for the sake of coolness and moisture or finally it may in its turn be driven to flee with all speed before the lightninglike onset of some bird of prey always in full control of its movements even when flying at topmost speed it is continually changing its course describing in the air a bewildering maze whose paths cross interlace recede from and approach one another meet wind ascend descend interweave and mingle in a thousand different ways and after a plan so complicated as to defy representation to the eye by the art of drawing and scarcely to lend itself to description for the imagination through the medium of speech we have three kinds of swallows in france of which the best known is the martin black above with glints of blue and white beneath and on the rump it builds its nest in windowcorners under the eaves of roofs and on the cornices of buildings the materials it uses are fine soil chiefly that which is deposited by earthworms after digestion in little mounds over our fields and gardens the swallow carries it a beakful at a time mixes it with a little viscous saliva to make it stick together and lays it by courses until it takes the shape of a hemisphere attached to the wall and provided with a small opening at the top bits of straw give additional firmness to the masonry and finally the interior is lined with an abundance of little feathers the laying consists of four or five pure white eggs without any spots the nests are used year after year by the same pairs of birds being recognized by them on their annual return in the spring and made as good as new with a few repairs if some are left vacant by reason of the owners death in distant lands new couples profit by the fact dont they ever quarrel over the old nests asked jules very seldom swallows like to live in colonies and their nests touch one another sometimes to the number of hundreds on the same cornice each couple recognizes its own nest without the slightest hesitation and scrupulously respects others property in order to have its own respected there is among them a deep feeling of joint responsibility and they help one another with as much intelligence as zeal occasionally it happens that a nest is no sooner finished than it gives way either because the mortar used is not strong enough or because the masons were in too great a hurry and had not the patience to let one course dry before laying another or for some other reason on hearing of the disaster the neighbors hasten to console the unlucky pair and help them to rebuild all set to work bringing the best mortar straw and feathers and in fortyeight hours the nest is rebuilt left to themselves it would have taken the owners a fortnight to repair the damage thats the kind of friends in need i like to see declared emile but i have something still better to tell you let us suppose a swallow has been so careless as to become entangled in a mesh of loose threads and the more frantically it struggles to escape the more firmly it binds its fetters with wings and claws held fast it is in danger of perishing uttering piteous cries it calls on its comrades for help all hasten to give aid noisily making plans for relief and working away with beak and talons until they finally unsnarl the tangle and free the captive the happy event is then celebrated with chirpings of delight that is what i saw with my own eyes right here in the garden one day when mother ambroisine was bleaching some of the linen thread she spins on her distaff an author 6 of note tells us that he once witnessed something similar these are his words i saw a swallow that had unfortunately i know not how caught its foot in a slipknot tied in a string the other end of which was fastened to a roof gutter the birds strength was exhausted and it hung crying from the end of the string with an occasional effort to escape all the swallows in the neighborhood had assembled to the number of several thousand they formed a veritable cloud each one uttering cries of alarm and pity after considerable hesitation one of them hit on a plan for freeing their luckless companion and communicated it to the others whereupon they all set to work a space was cleared and every swallow within hail came one after another as in a ringgame and gave in passing a peck at the string these blows all delivered at the same point followed one another with only a seconds interval or less half an hour of this work sufficed to sever the thread and liberate the prisoner but the entire company of birds with a few exceptions stayed there until night chattering away incessantly though no longer in anxious tones but rather as if in mutual congratulation and animated comment again an insolent sparrow invades a swallows nest and likes it so well it wishes to stay the owners assail the intruder but the latter having a stronger beak and being also protected by the ramparts of the nest easily repulses their attacks ha so you wont budge then well see about that one of the two swallows remains to hold the blockade while the other goes for help the neighbors hasten to the spot consider the situation deliberate on means to be employed and finally conclude that it is out of the question to hope to dislodge by force an enemy so securely entrenched in the nest as in a strong redoubt there is but one opinion the invader cannot be ousted from the nest but the proprietors must at least be avenged no sooner said than done while a few courageous ones posted at the opening intimidate the interloper with their cries the others fetch a supply of their usual mortar soil moistened with saliva and little by little close the entrance to the nest who was the fool that time cried jules in high delight it certainly was the sparrow sealed up in its narrow prison and left to perish caught you nestrobber emile exclaimed clapping his hands the chimneyswallow or houseswallow also called barnswallow has chestnutred forehead throat and eyebrows a black back with violet sheen and a white breast and stomach its name of houseswallow is given to it because it seeks mans neighborhood and even nests inside our houses especially where there is but little commotion or noise open and empty rooms sheds and coachhouses the eaves of roofs the under side of balcony floors and the inside of tall chimneys are its chosen nestingplaces the nest itself is made of moistened clay mixed with straw and hay and furnished inside with feathers and dry grass it is in the shape of a halfcup wide open at the top the eggs are five in number white with small brown and violet spots the houseswallow is the most interesting of the tribe it is the farmers cheery companion and the guest of the barn while the martin prefers towns and the cornices of monuments its characteristic cry is a sweet little song which the father perched on the edge of the nest keeps repeating to the brooding mother to beguile the long hours of incubation this bird is found all over the world it reaches us after a long migration about the first of april twelve days before the martin and a month ahead of the swift the sandmartin is smaller and of less frequent occurrence than the other two swallows of which we are speaking its back is mousegray in color as are also its cheeks and a wide stripe across the chest while breast and stomach are pure white with its beak and clawspoor tools for such rough work did not energetic good will supply the deficiencyit tunnels into steep sandbanks by the waterside or into the face of cliffs and the walls of quarries making a hole with a narrow entrance and extending in a winding passage for nearly two feet at the further end a little space is hollowed out and furnished with a thick bed of straw dry grass and feathers all heaped together with no art there are laid five or six slightly translucent white eggs the sandmartin perches only on rocks to which it clings easily with its long and pointed claws it haunts the waters edge which it explores in rapid flight darting to and fro and snapping up the gnats attracted by the coolness it is said remarked jules that swallows take long journeys yes all our swallows migrate every year not from a love of wandering but from necessity many other birds particularly those that live on insects do the same swallows like bats live entirely on flying insects and when cold weather comes these are lacking what does the bat do then to keep from starving it goes to sleep answered emile yes it closes as tightly as it can the draft in the vital stovethat natural stove you know that gives us heat movement and animation by burning up our blood with the help of air the bat almost stops its breath in order to economize the fuel stored up in its little veins and make it last until the reappearance of insects at the approach of summer in a word it goes to sleep in the depths of some grotto falling into an unconsciousness resembling death birds however cannot thus save their fuel their little stoves are always burning away under forced draft because of the violent exercise of flying their temperature summer and winter is fortytwo degrees centigrade whereas mans is only thirtyeight when such a fire has to be kept going imagine if you can take a six months nap because there was nothing to eat in the larder it is quite out of the question what then do birds do unable to do as the bat does they form a bold resolve they leave their native land which is about to be stripped of flying insects by the cold and go far away sad to leave but not without the hope of returning some day they migrate the strong helping the weak the old and muchtraveled ones guiding the young and inexperienced they form in flocks and fly southward to africa where abundant food and a warmer sun await them with no compass but instinct to direct their course they cross the sea the vast expanse of water in which only an occasional islet offers them a haltingplace many perish in the crossing and many arrive faint with hunger and spent with fatigue but they do arrive at last it must be a trying time for the swallows when the day for starting comes jules observed a very trying time indeed for the bird has to tear itself away from its beloved haunts the place where it was born to face the fatigues and dangers of a tremendous journey a journey never before taken by the greater number of the emigrants in a general assembly the date of departure is fixed for about the end of august in the case of martins and sandmartins and later even as late as october for houseswallows this being arranged the martins gather for several successive days on the roofs of high buildings every now and then small groups detach themselves from the rest and circle about in the air with anxious cries taking a last look at their birthplace and bidding it farewell then they return to their companions and we may imagine fall to chattering about their hopes and fears as they prepare for the journey by a careful examination of their plumage which they oil a feather at a time after several repetitions of these touching farewells a plaintive twittering announces the fateful hour they must start launching themselves on their desperate adventure they take flight in a body toward the south houseswallows when the time for their departure approaches hold a consultation on some leafless tree and almost always in the rain the emigrating flock numbers three or four hundred birds swifts and nightjars the swift is that large black swallow that flies in flocks on summer evenings and utters a shrill cry as it passes hunting insects on the wing is its occupation it has a very short beak that opens wide a big gullet always coated with a glue that holds the captured game long and pointed wings which enable it to cover in continuous flight eighty leagues an hour and piercing eyes capable of seeing a gnat at a hundred meters distance or even farther every insect that ventures into the upper air is lost the swifts open beak is a living trap a trap that advances rapidly to swallow up the tiny prey if the bird has little ones it sometimes stows away its prey in its cheekpouches and when they are full returns to its nest to feed these provisions to the hungry mouths waiting to be filled discharging through its beak the accumulated flies moths and beetles what a slaughter of twilightflying insects takes place when the screaming flocks of swifts fly hither and thither circling about in the calm glow of sunset what an onrush of whirring wings what dash and eagerness how animated the scene some fly merely as chance dictates letting themselves glide gently through the air for the mere pleasure of the motion others describe intertwining circles without number others again soar aloft on motionless wings or let themselves fall from dizzy heights as if wounded and helpless still others follow a straight course racing toward some distant goal and then returning for a fresh start and finally there are those that go whirling in noisy companies about some lofty building but what of this one that darts across our vision in such hot haste it flashes past with three strokes of the wings and is lost in the haze of the distance what impetuosity children what amazing speed i have often wished i could fly when i was watching those birds said emile if i only had their wings to carry me to those blue mountains we see from here how i should like to go flying to the top of that highest peak and then come back as quickly as i went that wish my boy is common to us all every one must envy the swift its wings but certainly no one would ever think of envying it its feet why because they are so misshapen and the legs are so short that they cannot be used for walking all four toes point forward that tells you the swift does not perch being unable to grasp the supporting branch but must cling to walls for a brief rest after which it must take flight again starting with a falling movement as bats do guéneau de montbéliard tells us this swifts have to be on the wing a great part of the time they never voluntarily alight on the ground and if by some accident they fall to earth they cannot rise again into the air without extreme difficulty by dragging themselves up on to a little mound or by climbing with beak and claws upon a stone from which they can spread their long wings if the ground is quite level they either lie prone on the stomach or sway from side to side with a balancing motion or they manage to struggle forward a little by beating the earth with their wings after repeated efforts they sometimes succeed in flying off the earth therefore is to them a great danger that must be avoided with the utmost care any state between swift motion and absolute rest is hardly possible with them violent exercise in the air and perfect quiet in their place of retreatthese two as a rule make up their existence the only variation known to them is to hang on to some wall near their hole and then drag themselves into the nest by clambering along with the help of beak and any chance support that they can find usually they enter their retreat in full flight after passing and repassing its entrance more than a hundred times all at once they dart in so quickly that they are lost to sight before you know whither they are gone you feel almost inclined to believe they have vanished into thin air their nest is nearly always placed in a deep hole in the wall and at a great height it is made of hemp threads little wisps of tow bits of straw feathers rags and cottonlike down from poplar and willow catkins these materials are stuck together with the viscous saliva that constantly oozes from the swifts throat and serves as glue to entangle captured insects the bird spreads it over the nest and thoroughly moistens the successive layers in drying this saliva hardens and takes on the shiny appearance of gum giving consistency and even elasticity to the whole structure if you squeeze the nest between your two hands it will shrink up without breaking and when the pressure is removed it will resume its former shape the swift then furnishes its own adhesive cement but whence does it obtain the other materials it needs such as tow rags straw and feathers of course it is not so foolish as to go and pick them up from the ground where it might find them as other birds do for if it touched the ground it would certainly come to grief therefore it resorts to cunning as it reaches us rather late in the season it takes advantage of such holes as it finds already abandoned by the sparrows and there it finds abundant materials which it uses in its own way by sticking them together with its glue if the sparrows have not yet broken up housekeeping it boldly invades their nests steals bits of flock and tufts of hair straw and feathers a little from one and a little from another and makes with these its own nest in another hole in the same wall the female lays from two to four eggs pure white and rather elongated swifts seldom stay more than three months with us arriving after the swallows early in may they leave at the end of july the whitebreasted swift differs from the bird i have just described in being larger and having a white breast and stomach it is found in the region of the alps and of the pyrenees and frequents the mediterranean shores especially where the waves beat against high steep cliffs middle and northern europe are not visited by this bird its flight is even swifter than that of its black cousin and it flies habitually at a great height descending only when bad weather threatens it builds its nest at the summit of high steep rocks making it of straw and moss stuck together with the glue from its own throat the nightjar closely resembles the swift having like that bird a short beak which is very broad at the base and opens very wide while from the gullet comes a sticky saliva for holding fast any insects that are caught its size is about that of the thrush its plumage is light soft and shaded with gray and brown its eyes are large and prominent and very sensitive to light the base of its beak bristles with long stiff hairs and its legs are short but at the same time not ill adapted to walking as indicated by the sensitiveness of its eyes which cannot endure the full light of day and by the softness and lightness and gray color of its plumage which resembles that of the hornless owl the nightjar is a twilight bird it is the swift of the evening flying and hunting only when the sun is near setting by the fading light of a summer evening it may be seen scanning the ground in low flight to and fro over its surface after the manner of the swallow it flies with mouth wide open so that the air in striking the throat produces a low and continuous humming like that of a spinningwheel and is it from that humming sound that it gets its name of nightjar asked jules precisely but it does not make this humming sound for the mere love of hearing it its object is to snap up the twilightflying insects as it passes with distended beak big beetles sporting in the evening air junebugs and other plump winged creatures disappear in the viscous gullet while small butterflies moths gnats and mosquitoes become entangled by the dozen in the fatal glue if the game is large the bird swallows it at once whole and still alive if small it waits until it has caught a certain number and then swallows them all in one mouthful but does it really swallow big beetles and junebugs alive emile asked you can readily understand that in its headlong chase the bird has no time to dismember its captives pouncing upon the insect with wideopen beak snapping it up and gulping it downall this it does as it flies without a moments pause no sooner is the plumpest prey captured than down it goes alive and struggling into the birds crop a dozen of that sort of game must stir up a big rumpus in the birds crop was emiles opinion almost any other creature in the nightjars place would have its digestion ruined by a brisk company of coleopters kicking about in the stomach and tickling its walls with their rough and prickly legs but i am inclined to believe the bird has the means of quieting them immediately by smothering them with its digestive juices as it carries on the business of stuffing its crop with large live beetles it ought to know the secret of how to prevent their making a hole in its stomach but that does not lessen my admiration for its digestive powers no creature enjoys a more remarkable immunity from dyspepsia on a near view the nightjar is not a pretty bird its flat skull its tremendously yawning beak which seems to split the whole head in two its wideopen gullet red and slimy and powdered with the remains of moths recently devoured its large and prominent eyesall these give it somewhat the appearance of a toad that is why it is sometimes called the flying toad another common name for it is goatsucker based on a false belief as to one of its habits it likes to visit pastures and sheepfolds where it chases the beetles to be found there noting its frequent appearance among the sheep and goats shepherds imagined it came there to suck their milk if they had watched it more closely they would have seen the absurdity of any such notion a bird suck what nonsense but the more ridiculous an idea is the more likely it is to spread and the absurd name of goatsucker is better known in many places than the appropriate and expressive one of nightjar this bird comes to us from warmer lands toward the beginning of may and leaves us in september it builds no nest imitating in this various nocturnal birds of prey some hole in the ground or among broken stones at the foot of a tree or a rock and usually taken just as it happens to be suffices to hold the birds eggs which are two or three in number white with tawny and bluish spots in closing let me beg you to remember what we owe these bigthroated birds that hunt insects on the wing and more especially the swifts and swallows who defend our granaries and gardens our wardrobes and our very persons what would you think of any one who possessing the terrible secret of creating by the bushel moths gnats mosquitoes weevils and other destructive insects should let loose a swarm of these creatures in the air about us i should say hanging was too good for him answered louis but that is exactly what any one does who kills a swallow it is true he does not create moths and mosquitoes and other insects but he saves the lives of those that the swallow would have eaten and thus he is guilty of as grave an offense as if he had created them on purpose to turn them loose on us he does a wicked deed for he receives with deadly shotgun the pretty joyous creature messenger of spring and sunshine that comes trustfully asking his hospitality and the permission to build its nest under the eaves of his house he causes famine for he encourages the multiplication of those devouring hordes that levy every year on our farm products a tax that amounts to thousands of millions of francs in its total sum and is constantly increasing as insecteating birds decrease a wicked deed i say a deed which causes faminethat is what is really done by the murderer of swallows the birds beak there are many other small birds that live almost exclusively on insects and in so doing render a great service to agriculture a full account of them all would take too long and besides you are familiar with the greater number seeing them daily in the woods fields orchards and gardens i will confine myself therefore to the chief difference between insecteaters and birds that live on seeds and grain and then a glance at some of the habits of the most important species will complete our rapid review the food of small birds falls into two classes seeds and insects certain birds require millet hempseed pips and similar seeds of all kinds while others need grubs larvæ insects the choice of one or the other sort of food is determined by the shape of the beak just as a mammals diet depends on the structure of the animals teeth the molars of the horse and the ox call for forage to grind under their flat wide crowns but those of the wolf and the cat with their sharp edges need flesh to cut to pieces in the same manner the birds beak according to whether it is shaped this way or that whether large or small thick or slender strong or weak requires hard seeds that crack under the mandibles and in opening yield their kernels or the tender grub that is swallowed without having to be crushed show me your teeth we said to the mammal and i shall know what you eat show me your beak we might now say to the bird and i shall know whether you live on insects or seeds the beak of the bird that lives on seeds or grainthat is the granivorous birdis thick conical wide at the base and strong in proportion to the hardness of the seeds it has to crack open but the beak of the bird that lives on insectsthat is the insectivorous birdis thin slender delicate and weak in proportion to the softness of the insects it catches in our everyday speech we note this difference by applying to the small granivorous birds the general designation grosbeak while the insecteaters are often called slenderbeaked birds let us remember these two expressive words and formulate the general principle thus seeds for the grosbeak worms for the slender beak and now without further delay we will put the rule into practice here is a bird whose diet is perhaps a matter of uncertainty to you if i ask you what to judge from the shape of its beak is its customary food shall you be at a loss how to reply that strong beak so wide at the base must be meant for crunching the very hardest seeds was juless opinion yes emile chimed in that bird certainly lives on seeds it is written all over its big face it is indeed a consumer of all kinds of seeds it is the greenfinch of our copses greenish underneath and with a yellow border to its tail the dominant color of its costume green mixed with yellow has given it the name of greenfinch and this one seeds for the grosbeak worms for the slender beak repeated emile the beak has no strength it is rather long but thin the bird is an insecteater and one of the greediest for it belongs to the family of warblers those delightful songsters that would be afraid of getting hoarse if they ate dry farinaceous grain to keep their vocal cords flexible these artists must have the gentle lubricant furnished by caterpillars and the succulent flesh of larvæ they take good heed not to touch coarse seeds which would injure the voice this bird is the reedwarbler which lives on dragonflies small junebugs mosquitoes and horseflies snapping them up on the wing it builds its nest among the reeds in willow thickets it is reddish brown above and yellowish white underneath finally let us look at this third one another slender beak said emile another insecteater yes you see it isnt difficult the bird has three names among us washerwoman wagtail and little shepherdess washerwoman because it frequents the waterside in company with those that wash linen wagtail because it wags its tail at every step it takes and little shepherdess because it likes the society of shepherds and flocks it is ashcolored above white underneath and black on the back of the head and also on the throat and breast wagtails go hopping along in a lively manner over the sand at the waters edge looking for little worms every now and then they fly up a few feet into the air balance pirouette and alight again on some slight elevation they may also be seen skipping across the fields among the sheep and standing on the backs of the latter even in the shepherds presence in order to get the parasitic insects lurking under the wool they live on small slugs moths flies and larvæ midway between birds eating only seeds and those eating only insects must be placed in respect to their food those that have a mixed diet and eat according to season place and circumstances insects and seeds larvæ and berries their beak has neither a strong conical structure like that of purely granivorous birds nor a delicately slender form like the beak of the insecteaters but is between these two extremes this beak instrument of general utility is found in the lark that bringer of gladness to our plowed fields in the thrush and the blackbird lovers of grapes and juniperberries but not less fond of insects in the oriole that superb black and yellow bird so appreciative of cherries flavored with toothsome larvæ and in the starling devourer of figs grapes insects slugs and various kinds of seeds the starling is a magnificent bird almost as large as a blackbird brilliant with glints of metallic luster on a dark background its color is black with greenish sheen on head and wings and violet on breast and back most of the feathers are adorned with a reddishwhite spot at the very end it nests under the roofs of buildings in dovecotes and in hollow tree trunks the nest composed on the outside of straw and within of dry grasses and feathers contains four spotless whitish eggs starlings come to us in the autumn they fly in large flocks whirling about like grain winnowed in a sieve and sending forth piercing cries from high up in the air they alight in marshes and damp meadows where they destroy much vermin insectivorous birds now let us go back to the principal slenderbeaked birds eaters of insects only and consequently our greatest helpers they are all small in size delicately and gracefully formed and modest in dress among them we find the sweet singers that make the woods echo in spring with the refreshing songs of the opening season first there is the nightingale clothed all in brown except the under parts which are whitish in color listen to it some calm evening in may all is quiet so we need not lose a note of the birds hymn it begins with a few timid and tentative phrases thus         teoooo teoooo teoooo teoooo         shpe teoooo tokooa then it becomes more animated         teo teo teo teo teo         kooooteoo kooooteoo kooooteoo kooooteoo tskooo         tskooo tskooo tskooo         tseeee tseeee tseeee tseeee tseeee tseeee here the phrasing becomes more marked the melody quicker         dlo dlo dlo dlo dlo dlo         kooeoo trrrrrrritz         lululu lelelele leeleeleelee enthusiasm then bursts all bounds and the bird indulges in the most brilliant roulades but our harsh alphabet is powerless to show the sounds that come from this wonderful throat the nightingale says buffon begins with a timid prelude in weak and almost wavering tones as if wishing to try its instrument and win the attention of those within hearing but presently gaining assurance it gradually becomes animated and displays all the resources of its incomparable organ bursts of melody lively volleys of rippling song in which clearness is equaled only by volubility low and voiceless murmurs inaudible to the listener but calculated to increase the brilliance of the notes about to be heard vivid and rapid trills that sweep the gamut and are articulated with force and even with a certain hardness of effect not unpleasing to the ear plaintive cadences softly modulated notes struck without art but full of soul enchanting and poignant chords that seem to come from the very heart and to convey a touching significancesuch are the impassioned strains by which in a tongue doubtless full of sentiment this natural songster appears to try to charm its mate or rather to contend before her with his jealous rivals for the prize of supreme excellence in song i have seen unfeeling barbarians cut short this pretty romance with a shot from a gun they say that half a dozen nightingales make an excellent broiled dish horrors what a frightful brute is man when he thinks of nothing but his stomach the nightingale builds its nest in bushes and rather near the ground sometimes even among the roots coarse grasses and oak leaves are used for the outside tufts of fleece and horsehair for the inside the female lays five darkgreen eggs with the nightingale though less wonderful as singers are to be classed the warblers thirty or more species of which can be counted in europe all live on flies caterpillars small beetles spiders and larvæ of various kinds their nests are constructed with much art some nest in trees and hedges in our gardens others prefer thickets and lonely groves still others choose holes in tree trunks and walls others again build on piling that projects above the water in marshes that is they unite three or four slender reeds with a ligature and build their nest on this swaying support others finally content themselves with a little hole in the ground among the bestknown of these birds is the blackcapped warbler so named on account of the black hood that covers the top of the head and the nape of the neck you remember it is one of the cuckoos victims as was proved by the egg found a few days ago in the nest at the foot of the garden then we must include the babbling warbler lover of copses orchards and gardens the little red warbler which visits our fruittrees and says zipzap zipzap zipzap the marshwarbler which builds its nest among the marsh reeds and the alpine warbler guest of chalets and tuneful songster of high snowy mountains now let us look at the fallowfinch or whitetail which flies from clod to clod in our fallow fields whence its name of fallowfinch and in flying spreads its white tail a target for the huntsman and the reason for its second name it is ashcolored on the back and reddish white underneath with black wings and eyebrows it frequents cultivated fields to catch the grubs turned up by the plow its nest placed under a clod of turf amid a pile of stones or in a hole in some dry wall is made of moss grass and feathers the eggs five or six in number are light blue the fallowfinchs chosen haunts are dry rocky uplands where it may be seen in the autumn in large flocks flying from one rock to another and from one clod to another keeping close to the ground by the fallowfinchs side let us place the stonechat a little lively active bird always seen perched on the topmost branch of a bush or bramble where it repeats with frisky movements its short cry of ooistratra ooistratra if from this place of observation it sees an insect on the ground it flies down seizes it and returns in a trice to its perch by a short curving flight like that so characteristic of the shrike its plumage is brown with red breast and black throat the sides of the neck together with the wings and the rump are ornamented with white stonechats frequent hedges that border sown fields and dry pastures and are never seen any more than are fallowfinches in damp lands along the banks of rivers they build their nests in which they lay five or six greenishblue eggs among the roots of bushes in crevices in rocks and among piles of stones i should count it almost a crime to omit here the robin redbreast in my opinion the most pleasing of our smaller birds in its wideawake manner its gentle look and its friendly curiosity which makes it come and pick up the shepherds crumbs when he is eating his lunch at the first dawn of day it begins its lively song uttering now and then a note or two that recall certain parts of the nightingales more elaborate performance who does not know its alert cry from the depths of some clump of bushes treet teereeteeteet teereet teereeteeteet and its call to some passing member of its kin ooeep ooeep the redbreast is greenish brown above bright red on the throat and breast and white on the stomach it nests in the densest woods amid the mossgrown tree roots and its nest made of leaves horsehair tufts of wool and feathers contains from five to seven whitish eggs spotted with red in winter the redbreast leaves the forest draws near our farms and even ventures into our houses in quest of food god forbid boys that you should ever betray its confidence when on a stormy winters day it comes discreetly tapping with its beak on the windowpane asking hospitality welcome the poor little famished creature and it will pay you a hundred times over with its gentle warbling and its zeal in defending the fruits of the earth but enough about the slenderbeaks you ought by this time to appreciate the immense help we receive from these legions of insecteaters which share the work of the fields hedges meadows gardens woods and orchards and wage incessant warfare on every sort of vermin that would destroy our harvests unless others than ourselves were constantly on the watchothers cleverer and endowed with sharper eyesight and greater patience for the unending hunt and also having nothing else to do i am not exaggerating i assure you without our insectivorous birds we should soon suffer from famine who then except an idiot with a mania for destruction would dare touch the nests of these birds of the good god that enliven the countryside with their varied plumage and protect us from insects there are i well know unruly boys who tired of their books and lessons delight to play truant and make a pastime of climbing trees and searching hedges in order to toss the newborn birds out of their nests to a miserable death and to smash the eggs the rural guard is on the watch for these wicked thieves and the law punishes them that our fields and orchards may enjoy the birds protection and continue to produce their sheaves and their fruit granivorous birds it might at first seem that i ought to be as lenient toward those who hunt granivorous birds as i have just shown myself severe toward the destroyers of insectivorous birds for can it be denied that birds given to a vegetable diet are harmful to our crops that they plunder our grainfields and devour great quantities of seeds buds fruit and young garden plants some of them know how to extract the wheat grains from the ear and others boldly come to get their share of the oats thrown to the poultry in our barnyards others again prefer the juicy flesh of fruit and know before we do when cherries are ripe or pears are mellow so that when we come to gather in the harvest all that we find is merely what they have left there are even some that have a queershaped beak for splitting fruit open and dividing it into quarters so as to get at the pips which are to them the very choicest of titbits look at this ones beak and tell me if you have ever seen a more singular tool the two mandibles cross each other said jules instead of meeting they go crisscross like the blades of an old pair of scissors out of order what can such a rickety beak be good for emile asked with its tips pointing one up and the other down it will never be able to pick up a seed from the ground consequently it does not get its food from the ground its manner of proceeding is more complicated first i will say that the bird is known as a crossbill from the position of the two mandibles this odd arrangement is not the result of an accident to the bird as for instance a sprain following some violent effort it is not a crippled beak nor is it a rickety beak as emile calls it but a beak in its natural and perfect state the bird is born with this odd beak and has never had any other it is even extremely doubtful whether it would consent to make a change if it had the opportunity so useful a tool is this beak for the work it has to do the crossbill has a fondness for pine seeds above all other food take a pinecone and lift the scales with the point of a penknife you will find behind each scale two seeds full of oil and smelling slightly of resin they are the titbits the bird is after but how get at them under scales so hard and so firmly held in place in vain would the grosbeak hammer at these scales with its strong tool it would never succeed in opening them even we ourselves with the aid of a knife find it difficult but the crossbill makes play of this hard work it inserts the tip of one mandible under the scale and using the other as a fulcrum pries with a turning movement until the scale is lifted and the seed laid bare and the whole thing is done in next to no time a key turning in the lock does not push the bolt more easily i must change my mind jules acknowledged about this beak that at first seemed to me so awkward it is a firstrate key to force the lock of a pinecone and it is not less useful proceeded his uncle in quartering apples and getting out the pips i should not like to have crossbills by the dozen in any orchard of mine they would soon tear all the fruit to pieces fortunately it is not our level plains that these birds choose as their haunts but cold mountainous regions covered with dark forests of conebearing evergreens their plumage is bright red more or less tinged with green and yellow crossbills breed in the coldest countries of europe and build their nests even in midwinter their materials are moss and lichens made to shed the melting snow by a coating of resin i shall enter no plea for the crossbill its taste for apple and pear seeds is a serious matter but i will mention certain things that seem to plead for the granivorous birds as a class first the greater number of these birds feed on wild seeds of no value to us even if not actually harmful to our cultivated fields we weed our tilled land clearing it of all plants that exhaust it to no purpose many granivorous birds also weed in their own way they gather the seeds that would otherwise infest the soil for example must we not acknowledge the services of the goldfinch which when thistles have matured alights on their prickly heads and searches for the seeds amid the thistledown i need not describe this pretty little bird so well is it known to you all it has a splash of red on its head said emile with yellow black and white on its wings yes that is the goldfinch its nest which is one of the most carefully built to be found anywhere is placed in the fork of some flexible branch the outside consists of mosses and lichens with a padding of down from thistles and other plants bearing seeds that have silky tufts as for example the groundsel and the dandelion the inside artistically rounded is lined with a thick layer of horsehair wool and feathers the eggs five or six in number are white with reddishbrown spots chiefly at the large end the goldfinch merits our gratitude it cheers us with its singing and works diligently at weeding lands infested with thistles and groundsel i will say as much in favor of the linnet which feeds on all kinds of small seeds in our fields and to that extent follows the honorable trade of weeding at the same time i will not hide its liking for linseed which has given it the name it bears it is very fond of hempseed also but hemp and flax are not found everywhere and the bird manages to get along very well without them by gathering a quantity of other seeds more or less harmful to agriculture it likes to breed in hilly country choosing some thickly grown junipertree or bush its nest contains five or six white eggs with red spots its plumage is brown with a dash of crimson on head and breast to the part of weeders seedeating birds add a second even more praiseworthy one seeds it is true furnish their customary food but most of the birds devour a great number of insects when these are plentiful and easy to find if they lack the patience to hunt for worms in their most hidden retreats with the painstaking care of the slenderbeaks they at least profit by those that fortune places within their reach a few grubs to season their regular diet of seeds are a godsend to them and moreover their favorite seeds may by some mischance be lacking in their neighborhood not every day can the goldfinch find thistleseeds nor the linnet flaxseed what then is to be done except to have patience and in the meantime eat insects last but not least in their young days when weak and featherless they are fed from the parents beak many granivorous birds are brought up on insects the reason is plain enough you can readily understand that the delicate crop of a young bird just out of the shell has not the strength to digest hard dry seeds it must have something more nourishing something smaller and above all more succulent such as a marmalade of grubs prepared in the mothers beak a few days later with the first growth of down will come little soft caterpillars served whole then tougher insects will prepare the stomach for the more difficult digestion of seeds i select a few examples at random the chaffinch the gay chaffinch is well known to be a granivorous bird a lover of millet and hempseed now what does it give its little ones while they are still in the nest it gives them hairless caterpillars and tender larvæ chosen as being the easiest food to digest i can say the same of the greenfinch a bird with plumage midway between green and yellow of the bullfinch known by its red breast and stomach and of the various buntings that come in the winter in flocks pecking around our strawstacks these last however feed perhaps more than the others on seeds as they have on the inside of the upper mandible a small hard excrescence intended expressly for crushing them i might add to these examples but prefer to conclude with a bird that is one of the most familiar to you the sparrow here certainly we have an undoubted seedeater it raids our dovecotes and poultryyards and steals the food of our pigeons and poultry it goes aharvesting in the grainfields before our reapers have begun their task a great many other misdeeds are laid at its door it strips cherrytrees plunders our gardens forages for sprouting seeds regales itself on young lettuce and nips the first little leaflets of green peas but when hatchingtime comes this bold pilferer is transformed into a helper inferior to none at least twenty times an hour the father and the mother by turns bring a mouthful to their young ones and each time it consists of either a caterpillar or an insect large enough to require quartering or perhaps a larva as fat as butter or it may be a grasshopper or some other small game in one week the brood consumes about three thousand insects including larvæ caterpillars and grubs of all kinds i have counted in the immediate vicinity of a single nest of these birds the remains of seven hundred junebugs besides small insects without number behold what a store of food is needed for raising only one brood what quantities of vermin then must all the broods of a community devour after such services let him who will presume to raise a hand against our sparrows as for me i leave them in peace as long as they do not become too troublesome my closing word is this eaters of seeds and eaters of insects grosbeaks and slenderbeaks some in greater degree some in less all come to our aid peace then to the little birds the joy of the countryside and the protectors of our crops snakes and lizards i propose today to undertake the defense of reptiles which many people fear and dislike even look upon with horror i have shown you what services are rendered by bats despite the repugnance we feel for them these animals regarded by us as hideous and treated as enemies i have brought you to look upon as valuable helpers veritable swallows of the night devoted to the extermination of twilight insects as soon as reason illuminates the darkness of prejudice the detested creature is found to be a very useful animal in like manner i shall now try to make you separate the false from the true in respect to the reptiles let us begin with the snake if to explain our dislike for bats we mention their strange and repulsive appearance we have not the same excuse in regard to snakes their slender form is not lacking in grace the suppleness they display in their undulating movements is pleasing to the eye and their scaly skin is decorated with welldefined colors that are prettily arranged our aversion then must be otherwise explained some serpents are venomous they are armed with a formidable and deathdealing weapon certainly it is not for these that i ask your favor indeed if it were in my power to exterminate them all i would gladly free the earth of their presence but othersand these are far more numerousare not venomous and consequently are perfectly harmless unless they are large enough to hurt us by muscular force which is not rare in the hot countries of the equator but never to be feared in our part of the world where the largest snake is not so strong as a mere child thus it is that some are much to be feared on account of their venom while others at least those of this region are not in the least dangerous but we are all too prone to lose sight of this difference in serpents the evil reputation of the one with venomous fangs is fastened on all the others so that we abhor them all alike because we believe them all to be venomous in france we have only one venomous serpent the viper and all the others large as well as small are perfectly harmless and we will refer to them simply as snakes in one of our former talks 7 i told you about the viper describing its form and coloring the structure of its venomous apparatus and the effects of its bite i here repeat the principal facts then related in order to give you now a connected account of our serpents as a class all serpents dart back and forth between their lips with extreme rapidity something that looks like a black thread of great flexibility and ending in a fork many persons believe this to be the reptiles weapon the sting as they call it whereas in reality it is nothing but the tonguea quite inoffensive tongue which the creature uses for catching insects to feed upon and also for expressing in its own peculiar fashion the passions that agitate it this last it does by shooting the tongue swiftly in and out between the lips all serpents without exception have a tongue but in our country it is only the viper that possesses the terrible apparatus for injecting venom this apparatus is composed first of two fangs or long sharp teeth situated in the upper jaw unlike ordinary teeth these fangs are not fixed firmly in their sockets but can at the creatures will stand up for attack or lie down in a groove of the gum and remain there as harmless as a stiletto in its sheath in this way the viper runs no risk of wounding itself the fangs are hollow and pierced near the point with a very small opening through which the venom is discharged into the wound they give finally at the base of each fang is a small pocket or sac filled with a venomous liquid it is to all appearance a perfectly harmless liquid odorless and tasteless so that you would take it for nothing but water when the viper strikes with its fangs the venom sac discharges a drop of its contents into the tiny channel perforating the fang and the liquid is injected into the wound it is by mixing with the blood that the venom produces its terrifying effects i remember all that very well said jules and also what you said must be done to prevent the mixing of the venom with the blood in general that circulates through the body and i also told you that the viper haunts by preference warm rocky hills it lurks under stones and in underbrush in color it is brown or reddish with a dark zigzag stripe along the back and a row of spots on each side each spot fitting into one of the angles made by the zigzag stripe its stomach is slatecolor and its head rather triangular in shape being broader than the neck and running to a blunt point at the mouth the viper is timid by nature and attacks man only in selfdefense its movements are abrupt irregular and sluggish what does it live on jules inquired does it eat nothing but little insects that it can catch with its tongue its chief food consists of larger prey which calls for the use of its venomous weapon small fieldrats fieldmice meadowmice moles sometimes frogs and even toads are its usual victims the animal attacked by the reptile is first stung with the venomous fangs whereupon it is immediately overcome with agony as soon as the prey is dead the viper twines its folds about the lifeless body squeezes it tightly and subjects it to a sort of kneading process in order to make it smaller for the victim must be gulped down in one mouthful even if it exceeds the serpent itself in size this preparation finished the gullet opens to its utmost width and the two jaws seeming almost to fly apart seize with their sharp teeth which point backward toward the throat the head of the mole or fieldmouse or whatever the small game may be a flow of saliva then streams over the body to make it slip down more readily but it is so large a mouthful that the viper manages to swallow it only by a violent effort the throat dilates and contracts the jaws move alternately from right to left and from left to right to coax the unwieldy mass downward and so it is that this laborious swallowing is protracted sometimes for hours sometimes for a whole day indeed it not seldom occurs that the forward half of the prey is already undergoing digestion in the stomach while the hind quarters still stick in the throat or protrude from the mouth let us pass on to the common snakes these have no venomous fangs in the jaw their teeth are small and even and lacking in strength useful as an aid in holding the captured prey and helping in the swallowing of it which is as difficult as with the viper but incapable of inflicting a serious wound these creatures too are extremely timid fleeing at the slightest alarm but if retreat is cut off they put on a bold front to impose on the enemy coiling themselves in a spiral erecting the head swaying this way and that hissing and trying to bite there is no need however to be afraid a scratch of no more importance than a pinprick would be the worst that could befall one you would suffer far greater injury by thrusting your hand into a bramblebush if it isnt any more dangerous than that jules declared boldly i shant mind taking up snakes in my hands i do not tell you this to encourage you to capture these creatures and make playthings of them on the contrary i wish you to leave them alone but i also desire to remove an unwarranted fear the fear of snakes that is so prevalent in country districts fear always an evil counselor never does a good deed in prompting one to throw stones at a harmless creature found in a hole in the wall the passerby attacks it with his stick if he sees it crossing the road and the mower in the hayfield cuts off its head with his scythe were they not listening to a foolish fear and yielding to an unreasonable dislike they would leave the poor thing in peace and no one would be the worse for it as snakes not only are harmless but they render us excellent service by destroying numerous insects and small rodents such as meadowmice and fieldmice from this point of view snakes deserve protection and not the hatred that is commonly felt for them but objected louis they say snakes can charm birds by their gaze and draw them into their open mouth by first overcoming them with their poisonous breath helpless the bird plunges headlong into the creatures horrible gullet there is a grain of truth in what you say but far more untruth the result of popular superstition which deliberately credits the serpent with sorcery in the first place the breath of a serpent or of any reptile whatever has nothing poisonous about it nothing magically attractive nothing supernatural you all have too much common sense to make it necessary for me to dwell on these ridiculous tales there remains only the belief that the bird is charmed by the reptiles hard fixed gaze the marvel of this amounts in reality to very little some of our snakes are very fond of birds eggs they climb trees search out the nests and eat the eggs when the mothers are not there to protect them more than one human nestrobber who thought he was seizing a jays or a blackbirds brood has put his hand instead on the cold coiled body of a reptile in the bottom of the nest i have even known instances in which the plunderers seized with horror at this unexpected encounter fell backward from the treetop and did not come out of the adventure without broken bones a warning to others the larger snakes do not content themselves with eggs but devour the young birds as well even those that are outside the nest when they can catch them which fortunately is not easy imagine an innocent little bird surprised by a snake in the underbrush the poor little thing suddenly sees before it a mouth horribly wide open and glittering eyes regarding it steadily scared almost to death the bird loses its head and is powerless to take flight in vain it beats its wings cries plaintively and finally falls from the branch paralyzed and dying the monster lying in wait catches the poor thing in its mouth the power to charm that serpents are supposed to have is therefore in reality only the power so to terrify a bird that it cannot fly we ourselves on being suddenly confronted by an appalling dangerdo we always retain the presence of mind necessary to face it are there not plenty of persons that get bewildered lose their wits completely and make matters worse by acting foolishly the charm exerted by serpents all comes down simply to that i am inclined to believe that a bird on being surprised by a snake usually is able to overcome the first feeling of terror and to take flight as soon as it sees the reptiles horrible gullet yawning to receive the expected prey and so the serpents attempt to paralyze its victim has a chance to succeed only with very young and inexperienced birds what paralyzes with fright an ignorant young nestling hardly affects a bird that is master of itself what terrifies a child or a person of weak character makes little impression on a man capable of keeping his head in time of danger acquire the habit children of keeping calm in times of danger or excitement and you will avoid many calamities and escape many perils just as the bird that does not lose its head escapes the snake lurking in ambush to catch it one of our common snakes is the watersnake so called because it likes damp places and frequents still water where it shows itself a good swimmer in its pursuit of little fish water insects and tadpoles it lays its eggs usually in dunghills where they will be hatched out by the heat these eggs are of an elongated oval shape with a soft shell resembling wet parchment in size they are about as large as a magpies eggs they are joined together in a string by a semiliquid viscous substance on stirring a heap of dung country people often turn up with their forks these softshelled eggs whose origin is unknown to them and from which to their great surprise come young serpents they declare them to be roosters eggs unnatural eggs magic eggs that produce snakes instead of chickens and it would be difficult to convince them that this is not true as for you my children if you ever happen to hear any one speak of eggs laid by roosters in dunghills and producing serpents remember that they are simply the eggs of the watersnake put no faith either in still another fable current in our villages according to this all snakes have a consuming desire to enter the mouth and then the body of any one sleeping on the cool grass to rid the patient of this inconvenient guest the serpent must be lured from its retreat by the smell of warm milk of course this is pure nonsense as no animal can wish to take refuge in the human stomach where it would be digested reduced to pap by the same process that digests our bread one often meets in hayfields or even in hay itself a small reptile differing from the snake in structure it is known as the slowworm or blindworm its head is small and merges into the body without narrowing into a neck furthermore the tail is blunt so that the two ends of the body are of nearly the same shape and leave us for a moment in doubt as to which is the head and which the tail the slowworm is covered with very smooth and shiny scales the back is silvery yellow and marked from one end to the other by three black lines which change as the worm grows older to a succession of dots and even disappear entirely at last the stomach is blackish on being disturbed the slowworm forcibly contracts stiffens and becomes almost as rigid as a lizards tail many people believe that this little creature is venomous and even to touch it or meet its eye is thought to be very dangerous but its evil reputation is quite undeserved the slowworm is really the most harmless of reptiles it does not even offer to bite in its own defense but contents itself with stiffening until it is as rigid as a wooden rod it lives chiefly on beetles and earthworms now to conclude this brief account of snakes vipers excepted not one of our serpents is venomous none can harm us the bite of none is in the least dangerous snakes do us no injury whatever on the contrary they help us by destroying a multitude of insects and small rodents let us then conquer an unreasonable horror and hatred and suffer these helpers of ours to live in peace equal consideration should be shown to lizards those agile hunters of insects and even of small furbearing game such as rodents who does not know the little gray lizard lover of sunny walls it lies in wait for flies darting its tongue in and out as if in play and it ransacks one hole after another in quest of insects it is the protector of wallfruit when on a fine spring day the sun shines warm on some wall or hillside the lizard may be seen stretched out comfortably on this wall or on the new grass covering the hillside it steeps itself delightedly in the healthful warmth it shows its pleasure by gentle undulations of its relaxed tail and by its shining eyes and presently perhaps it darts like an arrow to seize some small prey or to find a spot still more to its liking far from fleeing at the approach of man it seems to regard him with friendliness but at the slightest alarming sound as the fall of a leaf it rolls over falls and remains motionless for some moments as if stunned by the fall or else it darts away vanishes from sight reappears hides again then comes forth once more turns and twists until the eye can hardly follow it folds itself over several times and finally retires to some shelter to recover from its fright as useful as it is graceful in form the little gray lizard lives on flies crickets grasshoppers earthworms and nearly all insects that prey upon our fruit and grain thus it would be much to our advantage if the species were more widely scattered the greater our supply of gray lizards the faster should we see the enemies of our gardens disappear the green lizard so common everywherein hedges on the skirts of woods in thickets having an undergrowth of wild grassattains a length of three decimeters the back shows an elegant embroidery of green pearls set off with black and yellow dots this little creature is marvelously swift of foot darting into the midst of underbrush and dry leaves with a suddenness that always takes one by surprise and causes at first a little start of fear when it is attacked by a dog it throws itself at the assailants snout and plants its teeth with such determination that it will let itself be carried along and even killed rather than relax its hold but its bite is not at all venomous it merely punctures the skin without leaving in the wound any kind of poison in captivity it becomes very tame very gentle and willingly lets itself be handled its food consists chiefly of insects the olivegrowing districts of france have another lizard larger stronger heavier and more squat in form than the common green lizard the people of provence call it the glassbead but scientists give it the name of ocellated lizard from the small black spots scattered like little eyes ocelli in latin on the bluishgreen background of the creatures back this lizard haunts dry hillsides exposed to the full heat of the sun it bores for itself a deep hole in some sandy spot generally under the shelter of a projecting stone trusting to its formidable bite it is very bold not only does it leap at dogs snouts but it will even attack man if it finds itself too hardpressed this courage has won for it a terrible reputation among country people who think it very dangerous more venomous than even the viper now uncle paul who knows this lizard as well as he knows the bottom of his own pocket who has watched its movements for whole days in order to learn its habits who has examined its teeth very carefully so as to be able to report with authority on its bite and who has even let himself be bitten by it in order to leave no doubt on the subjectuncle paul i say declares that this dreaded lizard does not deserve the reputation it bears it is not venomous in the least it bites hard it is true nipping the skin and even taking away a piece but without poisoning the wound in a word it is no more to be feared than the common green lizard its food consists of beetles grasshoppers and small fieldrats and therefore despite the fear it inspires i have no hesitation in placing the ocellated lizard in the class of helpers the batrachians i have kept until the last the ugliest and the least esteemed of our helpers the toad with it must be classed the frog and the treetoad because of their close resemblance to it in form and still more because of the similar change all three undergo in developing from the egg to the fullgrown animal common language gives the name of reptile from a latin word meaning to creep or crawl to the snake and the toad the lizard and the frog and all similar hairless animals having either no legs at all or very short ones and crawling on the stomach science however makes a difference it limits the name reptile to the snake the lizard and other animals having a scaly skin and hatching from the egg in the form they are to keep and it gives the name batrachian from the greek batrachos a frog to the toad frog treetoad and some others which have a naked skin and whose first shape gives place later to a different one reptiles do not undergo a complete change batrachians do just as the butterfly is first a caterpillar quite different in structure its way of living and its diet from what it finally becomes in its perfect state so the toad the frog and the treetoad begin their existence as tadpoles with none of the structure and habits they are finally to have tadpole or bighead that is the word to indicate the batrachian in its transitory state a very large head merging into a plump stomach that ends abruptly in a flat tailsuch is the animal in the beginning it has no limbs no organs of locomotion unless it be the tail which whips the water to push the creature forward and serves as oar and rudder at the same time the toad tadpole is small and entirely black the frog tadpole is much larger silvery on the belly and grayish on the back all tadpoles inhabit still waters as ponds or pools warmed by the sun but for toad tadpoles even shallow puddles or wagonruts with a few inches of rain will suffice where they can gather in black rows or stretch themselves flat on the stomach in the tepid mud at the waters edge frog tadpoles however thrive best in ponds of some extent with various waterplants and sufficient depth for diving and swimming like fish tadpoles breathe the air that is in water and like them also they die if kept out of water a short time thus they are real fish as far as breathing is concerned but in their final form batrachians breathe atmospheric air and die of suffocation in water they are land animals in that state and breathe like other land animals you have very often seen frogs and toads in the water and no doubt you think they could live there indefinitely undeceive yourselves they go to the water only to lay their eggs or to escape from some danger or to bathe in hot weather but they could not remain under water any length of time without dying they have to come up at intervals to breathe which they do by getting at least the nostrils out here we have a difference between the tadpole and the fullgrown batrachian between the larva so to speak and the creature at its maturity the tadpole lives in water and perishes in the air whereas the frog that comes from it lives in the air and perishes in water and there is a still further difference the tadpole lives exclusively on vegetable matter its mouth is equipped with a sort of small horny beak to browse the foliage of waterplants and in its big belly it has a very long intestine coiled about several times so as to prolong the passage of the food through the body and thus make sure that all the juices it may contain are extracted the mature batrachian exchanges this horny beak for real jaws furnished with irregularities that serve as teeth it lives solely on an animal diet especially on insects and its intestine is short because the food it eats is easy of digestion and readily yields what nourishment it contains to turn a tadpole into a frog or a toad it is not enough to change its respiratory and digestive organs new organs form organs of which there was not the least sign when the creature was hatched while still others disappear without leaving any trace the tadpole is born absolutely without legs after a while the hind legs appear later come the fore legs and still later the tail shrinks and vanishes i remember seeing tadpoles said jules some with two legs some with four but every one of them had a tail when the tail has disappeared the animal is no longer a tadpole but a young toad or frog does the tail come off itself or does the animal pull it off emile inquired with eager interest neither the one nor the other the tail is too valuable when the change takes place to be thrown away in that reckless fashion it contains a store of material suitable for making something else in the bodily organism when the legs begin to put forth when the organs of digestion and those of respiration begin to take a new form these new creations these transformations require material with which to build fleshy substance is needed for the upbuilding of the body just as bricks and mortar are needed for the construction of the house of course the tadpole eats to make flesh and to provide a reserve for the work of transformation but this method of accumulation is slow and therefore to save time the organs useless to the future animal are destroyed bit by bit and their material is used in the construction of new parts it is thus that the tail disappears the blood circulating through it gradually eats it away dissolves it as we might say at the proper time and carries elsewhere the fluid substance which turned again into flesh helps to form the legs or other parts of the remodeled organism what a deal of economy in getting rid of a tadpoles tail exclaimed emile not a particle of it even if no bigger than a pins head must be thrown away for it might be used to make the little toe on one of the feet yes my boy a wonderful economy an economy careful of every atom of matter in order that life the divine worker may not fail to have at its disposal undiminished by waste the resources committed to its keeping by the creator for works that are unceasingly being destroyed and then restored on a new plan i should add here that certain batrachians keep the tail as long as they live to this class belong the salamanders one species of which the terrestrial or land salamander is extremely ugly in form it is halfway between a toad and a lizard and its color is black with large brightyellow spots it is from one to two decimeters long it haunts damp places near springs and eats insects and earthworms despite its repulsive appearance it is perfectly harmless the tadpole of the salamander breathes through fine tuftlike appendages which spread out in the water on each side of the neck these tufts are called gills and they correspond to the fishs breathing organs or gills which are likewise situated on each side of the neck under the tiny flap commonly called the ear tadpoles of the frog and the toad have for the first few days fringed gills floating out freely but in a short time they are drawn in under the skin and become invisible like the gills of fish frogs have a slender form not devoid of a certain grace their hind legs are very long and powerful being especially good at jumping the frogs customary mode of progress first gathering itself together the animal suddenly relaxes like a spring and throws itself forward by a vigorous thrust of the thighs the hind toes are very markedly webbed in other words they are united by a membrane as are the toes of swimming birds the duck in particular this arrangement of the toes so as to form a broad paddle or oar together with the suppleness of the hind legs which are alternately drawn up against the sides and then forcibly extended makes the frog an expert swimmer the common or green frog is spotted with black on a green background and it has three yellowish stripes on the back the belly also being yellow it abounds on the banks of all still waters and to it we owe the noisy croaking that comes from every ditch on a summer evening the red frog is spotted with black on a reddish background and is easily recognizable by the black stripe running from the eye over the ear it likes cool places such as damp meadows and fields and underbrush it is less fond of the water than the one just named and it croaks much less both live on live prey as for example aquatic larvæ worms flies and other insects and snails and they never touch vegetable matter therefore they are good helpers in our gardens treetoadsor less correctly treefrogsdiffer from ordinary frogs in having viscous cushions at the end of their toes which enable them to climb trees where they hunt insects they stay all summer in the foliage and go to the water only to lay their eggs their cry which gains force from a sort of pocket that shows plainly under the throat is very loud and raucous the treetoad that we have around here the common treetoad is of a beautiful delicate green hue on the back and yellowishwhite on the belly the toad what shall i say in defense of that poor creature the toad whose very name is enough to excite disgust it is really loathed by all it seems to us the ugliest and most disgusting of animals what has it done poor thing to deserve the dislike every one feels for it it is ugly the plaintiff asserts its flabby form is a shapeless lump thrown together as if in careless haste and its flattened dirtcolored back is strewn with livid warts its legs too short for symmetry or for effectual service are unable to lift out of the mud its swollen stomach which drags on the ground its big head merges into a hideous mouth and heavy eyelids open to show large and prominent eyes which stare stupidly if some danger threatens it puffs itself up forming under its skin an aircushion which resists blows with its flabby elasticity it is venomous the plaintiff further declares squatting in the mire at the bottom of some dark hole it absorbs the unwholesome humors of the slime for use in filling the warts on its back with a milky venom which oozes out and moistens the entire body in time of peril it also squirts into the eyes of any one who attacks it a liquid its urine which burns and stings it infects the atmosphere with its foul breath from its gullet drips a fluid that poisons the grass and fruit over which the animal passes so that its track is as fatal as its appearance is loathsome in a word the toad is ugly and venomous then war without mercy on the hideous creature that infects earth air water and by its very appearance disgusts the beholder there you have the charges against the toad now what shall i say in my turn in defense of the poor creature i shall tell the truth the simple truth and the charges made against it will be reduced to nothing as to the ugliness of the toad i will not say a word all are welcome to their own opinion on that subject i only ask you to recall our talk about bats i dont think the toad so horribly ugly jules ventured to assert its goldenyellow eyes are full of fire its voice is sweet almost flutelike while the frogs croak is anything but musical i admit that the toads bloated body is not graceful but after all it has some good points little toads hopping about among the reeds at the edge of the pond said emile are pretty to look at and they make me laugh when they tumble heels over head every time they jump i have taken them up in my hand but i wouldnt touch big toads i am afraid of them i wouldnt either jules agreed for fear of their venom ah the venom that is the serious side of the question and not the creatures ugliness which is open to discussion the toad has the beauty appropriate to it the beauty of a toad and it cannot have any other without ceasing to be what it is on being molested toads perspire through the warts that cover their skin a thick and viscous fluid that looks somewhat like milk this secretion has a nauseous burning taste and is unbearably bitter some one then has tasted the milky sweat that oozes from the toads warts asked jules yes scientists have tasted it in order to tell us the truth about it just as others have done with the vipers venom we must respect highly these courageous investigators who are willing to make any sacrifice if only they may add to our knowledge and relieve our sufferings the toad sweats this milky liquid when tormented is that the way it defends itself jules further inquired it hopes to defend itself by the horrid odor of its sweat and by its intolerably bitter taste but this sweat is put to no further use the animal would be truly dangerous if it could inject its sweat into our blood as the viper injects its venom through its fangs into the wound already made by them i will now relate a few experiments made by the scientists i just referred to a drop of the toads milky fluid is introduced with a pointed steel instrument into the flesh of a little bird in a few minutes the bird staggers as if intoxicated shuts its eyes gasps and falls dead really and truly dead asked emile really and truly dead his uncle replied a dog is treated in the same manner but with a stronger dose in less than an hour the animal dies in a frightful frenzy then this white sweat of the toad must be a perfectly horrible venom jules remarked travelers tell us that certain south american indian tribes poison the tips of their arrows with this venom first they impale alive on a long stick a number of these animals and then put them near the fire to make their warts sweat the fluid that oozes out is collected in a large leaf and into this fluid the savages dip their arrowheads a wound from which is then likely to prove fatal isnt it the truth then asked jules that toads are venomous yes and no applied in any way but by injection the toads sweat is harmless to act as venom it must mix with the blood through a wound but i will not repeat what i have already told you about the vipers venom the toad is powerless to make the slightest wound in our flesh and therefore it is absolutely impossible for it to harm us it possesses a poison without being able to make any use of it except to bedew its own body by perspiring thus repelling its enemies by the horrid smell and taste of this sweat you can handle a toad without any sort of risk if you wish to wash your hands immediately afterward if they have become moistened by the contact and there will be no further trouble unless the foolish fancy should seize you to collect a little of the venomous liquid on the point of a penknife and then prick yourself with the knife till you drew blood i can assure you positively that the toad would cause you no injury whatever that is plain enough jules admitted for the toad has no means of making a wound to receive the venom from its warts but they tell of other kinds of venom such as urine thrown to a distance and drivel running from the mouth no drivel runs from the toads mouth nor is there any truth in the animals poisoning fruit and grass with its saliva that is pure calumny invented to blacken the detested animal and the urine the toad when molested discharges its urine as a means of defense but not to any distance you would have to hold your face close to the animal to receive the discharge in the eyes if that should happen to some careless person a temporary redness of the eyes would be the utmost result but no one would think of putting his face so close to the animal and so there is no cause for alarm on that score what about the creatures terrible breath was juless next inquiry another calumny on a par with that about the saliva its breath is no more harmful than any other animals so there is absolutely nothing left of the charges brought against the toad the poison it sweats in moments of danger to drive away its enemies cannot injure as venom injures because the animal has no means of injecting it into a wound and mixing it with the blood as venom must be mixed to take effect the discharge of its urine falls too short to be dangerous and even if it should reach its mark its effect would be so slight that it is not worth considering does any one give a thought to the hedgehogs urine when that animal sprays itself with this liquid on being molested the toads similar mode of defense is no more to be feared the other complaints such as the swelling of ones hands after touching the animal air poisoned by its breath fruit and vegetables infected by the saliva and the creatures tracks all come from peoples prejudice their imagination which has given the poor batrachian a bad reputation the toad is harmless but that is not enough to entitle it to our consideration it is also a very useful helper a devourer of beetles slugs larvævermin of every description in short after spending the day under a cool stone or in some dark hole it leaves its retreat at nightfall to make its rounds hunching itself along on its big belly here is a slug making such haste as it can toward the lettuce bed there a cricket chirping at the mouth of its hole and there again a junebug laying its eggs in the ground very softly the toad approaches and in three mouthfuls gobbles them all up with a gurgle of satisfaction ah those tasted good and now for some more it continues on its way and by the time it has finished its rounds at daybreak you may imagine what a multitude of worms and other small prey the glutton has stowed away in its capacious stomach and yet this useful creature is stoned to death because it is ugly my children never commit any such act of cruelty at once foolish and harmful do not stone the toad for you would thereby deprive the fields and gardens of a vigilant guardian let it go its way in peace and it will destroy so many insects that you will in the end find it less ugly than you had thought so well known is the toads usefulness that in england the animal is an article of commerce toads are bought in the market at so much a head carried home carefully so as not to come to any harm and then allowed the freedom of the garden or placed in a hothouse a crystal palace perhaps where wonderful plants are grown the toads business is to lie in wait for beetles slugs and other destroyers that might nibble the valuable plants and it does its duty with zeal what a change of fortune for the maligned creature when it finds itself living in a warm atmosphere and surrounded by the most splendid flowers procured at great expense from all parts of the world and now exhaling the most fragrant odors as a finishing touch to the honor done the poor thing in its floral palace of glass there is offered the tribute of poetry that flower of the human imagination and invention listen to this a wretched toad with head split open and one eye gouged out by some cruel hand was painfully dragging itself along through the mud of a public highway when four small boys chanced to spy it as they were passing                             they spied the toad     and one and all sent up a gleeful shout     come on come on lets kill the ugly lout     but first well have some fun they laughed their fill     as boys will laugh hardhearted when they kill     they pricked and goaded with a pointed stick     devising each in turn some cruel trick     flushed with their sport egged on by passersby     while for the martyred toad none gave a sigh     poor ugly thing but nature made it so     for this alone its blood was caused to flow     it tried to flee one foot was severed quite     which gave the heartless band renewed delight     its gougedout eye hung down halfblind it sought     some sheltering reeds its efforts came to naught     its mangled form had been you would have sworn     through some machine to be so rent and torn     and oh to think that hearts can be so base     as to wish ill to one in such sad case     and to so great a load of suffering sore     to undertake to add one torment more     wellnigh exhausted now hope almost gone     the halfdismembered creature still toiled on     een death itself would not for pitys sake     so hideous a thing consent to take     or thus it seemed and so with antics rude     the toads tormentors still their sport pursued     attempts to snare it next were made in vain     it dodged and sought a rut half filled with rain     and by its muddy bath somewhat restored     withstood the missiles that upon it poured     ah what a sight was there the beauty fresh     of childhood and its joy in bleeding flesh     such sport as theirs there surely neer had been     come on they called come john come benjamin     and bring a stone a big one and well see     if master toad is quite as smart as we     accordingly a massive stone was found     of ponderous weight unwieldy large and round     but cheerfully the lads their muscles strained     with ends so laudable to be attained     just then by curious chance there passed that way     an overloaded heavyrumbling dray     an aged donkey deaf halfstarved and lame     was harnessed to the cartthe mores the shame     and on its back a pannier also bore     a long days march behind and home before     the patient beast trudged on with labored breath     though each step more seemed like to be its death     its toilworn frame was so exceeding thin     you would have said twas naught but bones and skin     it bore full many marks of cruel blows     and in its eyes one read the tale of those     that suffer hardship without hope meanwhile     its master heaped upon it curses vile     nor spared the cudgel but the road was deep     in mire that clogged the wheels the hills were steep     creaking and groaning in lugubrious tones     the dray thus pulled by thing of skin and bones     moved slowly forward till at length the road     descended sharply and thus eased the load     but this now crowded on the nighspent beast     with force sufficient so it seemed at least     to hurl him headlong and yet strange to tell     the donkey paused unheeding blows that fell     from wrathful hand the boys broke off their play     content to yield the donkey right of way     stand off they cried let go there dick and bob     let go the stone the cart will do our job     with much more sport for us so stand aside     all stood alert to see what should betide     their wretched victim but far otherwise     the thing fell out before their wondering eyes     than they had thought the donkey bruised and lame     at sight of woes that put his own to shame     spared not himself but gathered all his strength     and held the loaded cart until at length     although remonstrant blows rained on his back     he turned the dray from out the beaten track     the grinding wheels diverted harmless pass     and tortured toad is saved by tortured ass     the driver cracks his whip pulls at the reins     and now the dray once more the road regains     at that one of the group engaged in play     the very one who tells you this today     let fall the stone hed been about to cast     just as the laden wain came rumbling past     and as he dropped it lo in accents clear     a mandate from on high fell on his ear     a mandate that was quickly understood     for it was brief these simple words be good 8 in closing i repeat with the great poet be good be good if you wish god to love you be good that you may grow up to be noblehearted men be good to one another helping one another be good to the animals that give us their fleece their strength and their life and those that protect the fruits of the earth for us by keeping vigilant guard over them be kind to them all even to the humblest among them the toad which serves us uncomplainingly and asks in return no pay but a pitying glance instinct jules and emile had put a caterpillar into a glass and brought it to their uncle who made it the subject of a little talk to his young hearers examine the creature closely said he its skin is delicate so delicate that even a light touch hurts it but here on the head at the point called the skull it has the hardness of horn forming a sort of cap or helmet which can without injury endure friction with the hard texture of wood the head is the part of the creature that opens the way and it is therefore protected by armor while the rest of the body as it follows the head does not need this casing of horn i understand said emile the creature works its way along by scratching and tunneling with its feet no my boy the feet are not used for boring through wood the caterpillar has eight pairs the first three pairs or those nearest the head have quite a different shape from the others they are slender and pointed and it is they that in the change that takes place later become the butterflys legs though in doing so they grow much longer and take another shape hence they are called the true legs the next four pairs are placed toward the middle of the body and the last pair is at the very end these five pairs bear the name of false legs because they completely disappear when the caterpillar gives place to the butterfly or moth they are short and wide and are furnished beneath with numerous little hooks by which the caterpillar clings to the walls of its abode the stiff hairs covering the body are also used for locomotion the caterpillar wriggling and squirming in its tunnel somewhat as does the chimneysweep in helping himself with knees and back as he makes his way up the inside of a chimney then what does the caterpillar use for boring through the wood asked jules the tool for chipping away the wood consists of two curved fangs or teeth almost black one on each side of the mouth which open and shut like a pair of cutting nippers they are called mandibles and are in reality jaws or more properly teeth which instead of meeting in a vertical plane as do ours come together horizontally or sidewise for precision of movement these mandibles are superior to our best cutting nippers and for hardness they are almost equal to steel they seize the wood bit by bit patiently and untiringly they cut saw tear away a little at a time and so bore a tunnel just large enough for the caterpillar to pass through and what becomes of the wooddust jules further inquired i should think it would block the way the passage being so narrow the wooddust passes through the creatures body the caterpillar eats it and after digestion has taken from it the very small amount of nourishment it contains it is ejected behind molded into tiny pellets digestion in a caterpillar is soon accomplished just think of it wood is an extremely meager fare and so the worm must keep on eating its way forward cutting gnawing digesting to acquire the fatness necessary for the coming change the creature must have a goodsized peartree limb or lilac trunk to work on the wormhole dust left behind by the boring worm sometimes betrays the insect to its enemies whenever you see any of this dust left by digestion coming out at some little orifice in the bark of a peartree appletree or other tree you may know the borer is at work and the branch where he is at work should be cut off immediately to prevent more serious harm if the caterpillar has not gone too far a pointed iron wire may be thrust into the opening and an attempt made to kill the creature in its hole but as the passage is very winding this method is by no means certain of success couldnt the wire be pushed in through another opening queried jules but my boy you dont suppose the caterpillar is so simple as to make windows here and there in its dwelling and so make it easy for its foes of which it has many besides man to attack it if it should take a fancy let us say to go out and get a little fresh air some fine day a sparrow might spy it and carry it off as a choice titbit for its brood under the roof tiles all these dangers it knows or rather it guesses them vaguely for every creature even to the smallest worm knows how to protect itself and preserve its species unquestionably it lacks the reasoning faculty which belongs only to man but it none the less acts as if it reasoned out its own interests with an accuracy that astounds the thoughtful observer as a matter of fact my dear children another has already reasoned for it and that other is the universal reason in and by whom all live it is god the father of men and also the father of lilacs and of the caterpillars that gnaw them the creature knows then without ever having learned it is master of its art without having been taught and at the very first trial with no experience to rely on it does admirably the thing it was intended to do this gift bestowed at birth this unfailing inspiration that guides it in its work is called instinct in its butterfly state the leopardmoth takes very little food at the most a few drops of honey from the opening flowers its proboscis so slender and so delicate is fitted to get this food now that it no longer has its strong mandibles how can the moth imagine that wood is eatable is it possible that it remembers what it liked as a caterpillar who can say moreover how can the moth tell what trees have wood suitable for the larvæ when we ourselves must have a certain degree of education in order to know the commonest varieties the moth with no previous education never mistakes a planetree for a peartree a boxtree for a lilac an oak for an elm thus the eggs are always laid on the right sort of tree never on any other where man might make a mistake the insect never errs the young larva comes out of the egg what does the poor little thing know from experience of the hard trade it is to follow nothing absolutely nothing no matter as soon as it is born it attacks the wood it rests upon and hollows out a shelter for itself with the least possible delay this most urgent business being attended to it now leisurely gnaws its way ahead nibbling a little here and a little there and shaping its course according to the quality of the wood the passage lengthens increasing in diameter as the creature grows and sometimes ascending sometimes descending sometimes running horizontally quite through the trunk or branch the mass of the wood may be attacked with little system and without economy for the larva is assured of food enough in any event one precaution however it invariably takes it never bores through the bark for fear of betraying its presence to hostile eyes but how does the larva working in total darkness know when it is getting near the bark and must turn back what gives it the fear it has of showing itself what makes it so careful to remain in the heart of the wood and thus avoid the vigilant sparrow it has never seen it is instinct the inspiration that protects all animalkind in the fierce battle of life the grainweevil uncle paul had sent old jacques to town to buy the drug they were going to apply to simons wheat meanwhile he took occasion to tell his young hearers about the wheatdevourer that was to have the benefit of the drug the handful of grain left by simon was in a plate on the table the little weevils were running about in frantic endeavors to escape while emile with a straw was pushing them back into the middle of the plate where they cowered among the kernels of wheat louis and jules were also there all attention to what was going on this ravager of our granaries began uncle paul is called the grainweevil or in latin calandra it belongs to the order of coleoptera or beetles its defensive armor is a hard brown casing finely engraved it has no membranous wings under the elytra or wing sheaths hence it is unable to fly but it runs fast enough and it clings to objects with a firm grip you see how busy emile is kept with his straw in preventing the prisoners escape the grainweevil is about four millimeters long its body is of a uniform blackish brown and its head ends in a long snout a kind of slender trumpet the corselet or thorax is long marked with fine pricks or dots and the wing sheaths are delicately furrowed the insects most striking characteristic is its long trumpetshaped snout it seems to me said jules i have seen other beetles and rather large ones too with the head ending in a trumpet like that ive found them on hazels added louis and they had a long slender beak that would make you think the insect was smoking a long pipe the trumpet beetles form a numerous class and they are all weevils but their mode of life varies for the different species some attack fruittrees and grapevines we will speak of them one of these days with its pointed snout the grainweevil makes a tiny hole in a kernel of wheat and in this it lays an egg which it makes fast by means of a sticky liquid from its own body then it passes immediately to other kernels and treats them in the same way until its store of eggs is exhausted and all this is done with such delicate nicety that the sharpest eyes would fail to detect any trace of these mischievous germs in the kernels but a weevil knows very well when a kernel has already received an egg from whatever source and never does it commit the blunder of laying a second one there for the grain of wheat is too small for more than one eater to each kernel its larva to each larva its kernel and no more soon the eggs hatch the tiny worm punctures the envelop of the grain and through the almost invisible opening makes its way into the mealy substance within there it is at home in perfect quiet peacefully devoted to the pleasures of feasting for its own exclusive use a grain of wheat a whole grain of wheat thus it grows big and fat in five or six weeks the flour is all eaten up but the bran remains for the clever larva is careful not to make a hole in it it will need it to serve as a cradle during the coming change the gnawed kernel appears quite whole when as a matter of fact it is hollow and lodges a weevil in this hidingplace the larva turns into a nymph and the latter into a perfect insect then the fully developed weevil tears open the bran covering and leaves its home to explore the pile of wheat select certain ungnawed grains and lay its eggs in them eggs that will in time produce a new population of ravagers here uncle paul picked out a few grains one by one and submitted them to his hearers scrutiny what do you see that is at all unusual in those grains he asked look at them well i have looked and looked emile replied after a little and i dont see anything i dont see anything either said jules nor i added louis those grains boys have no flour in them despite their fair outside appearance the weevil has emptied them but how can you tell so easily asked jules a kernel inhabited by the grainweevil yields to the pressure of a finger and is also lighter in weight than one that is sound from appearance alone one cannot tell infested kernels from uninjured ones as the outside looks the same in both cases thus without extreme vigilance the inroads of the weevil pass unperceived until the developed insects show themselves and then the evil is beyond remedy didnt simon think he had a fine lot of wheat when there was hardly anything but the bran left a very simple experiment suffices to prove the condition of the wheat throw a handful of it into water and all the sound kernels will sink to the bottom all the unsound ones float on the surface we will perform this experiment with the wheat on the plate if jules will go to the spring and bring a glass of water the water was brought and uncle paul threw the wheat into it a few grains sank many floated these latter were opened with the point of a pin and in some was found a little soft white worm without legs but furnished with strong mandibles it was the larva of the grainweevil in others there was a white nymph and in a few was the perfect insect all ready to leave its snug abode to judge by the number of grains that floated jules remarked simons pile of wheat even if it is not a very big one must contain millions of weevils it must have taken a lot of the creatures to produce such an immense family mustnt it not so many as you might think how many eggs do you suppose one weevil lays a dozen perhaps ah how far out you are in your reckoning in the course of one season a weevil lays from eight to ten thousand eggs from which spring as many larvæ each gnawing a grain a liter measure 9 contains on an average ten thousand grains of wheat to feed the family of one weevil therefore nearly a liter of wheat is needed suppose there are a thousand pairs of these insects in a granary that would be enough to destroy ten hectoliters of wheat rye barley or oats for they attack all kinds of grain impartially the common caterpillar i remember said jules one sunday last winterit was some time in december or january i thinkthe mayor had just posted a notice on the door of the town hall and the people were reading it as they came from church the notice was something about caterpillars and the mayor had ordered their nests to be destroyed yes rejoined uncle paul the mayor had in mind luckily for us the caterpillar law what is there a law about caterpillars with a fine for disobeying it yes my boy there is a law about caterpillars and i thank the legislature that had the wisdom to pass it god grant it may become a more general statute and include a greater number of our insect enemies the junebug especially and that it may be strictly enforced but that would put people out to have to leave their business and go and hunt for caterpillarnests and burn them at least thats what oneeyed john said when he read the mayors notice leave their business you say is it leaving ones business to go and save the crops when they are threatened laws my young friend are rules made for the general good and we should all obey them scrupulously if there are any narrowminded objectors or stupid grumblersany oneeyed johns in shortthat choose to take offense so much the worse for them they will have to obey in any event for the common interest is not to be compromised by the foolishness of a few the mayors notice had especial reference to a caterpillar whose ravages are in some seasons truly calamitous so abundant is this caterpillar in central and northern france that it is called briefly the common caterpillar it is encountered everywhere on fruittrees and forest trees in garden walks and on plants and hedges and even on the bark of trees sometimes in countless legions it is dark brown in color with six rows of little tubercles or pimples of the same hue each bearing a tuft of long red hair the ringlike segment to which is attached the last pair of false legs and also the following segment have each a plump red nipple which can at the caterpillars pleasure recede under the skin or stand out prominently the butterfly developing from this caterpillar is pure white except on the abdomen which is brown furthermore the female has a thick tuft of red hair at the end of the abdomen its purpose is shown when the eggs are laid after these are deposited to the number of three or four hundred the butterfly rubs off the hair and places it over the eggs the laying takes place in july and the eggs deposited in a little heap on a leaf are rose red but if they are on a leaf objected emile they must fall from the tree when the leaves fall and then the wind might blow them away the butterfly that lays its eggs on a leaf knows very well what it is about on the other hand those butterflies that lay eggs that are to go through the winter and hatch in the spring are very careful not to entrust their eggs to a leaf which will soon fall to the ground they make their eggs fast to the bark but whence do they get their knowledge of the future who told them the leaves would fall and therefore would be insecure restingplaces for the eggs they do not learn this by experience for they have never seen the autumnal shedding of leaves having been born when the foliage is already well advanced for their nourishment and laying their eggs and dying while it is still on the trees if then experience cannot account for it we must ascribe the insects mysterious foreknowledge to the incomprehensible inspiration of instinct which sees the invisible and knows the unknown because there is a sovereign intelligence that knows all and orders all our common caterpillar likewise is led by instinct when it lays its eggs on a leaf for long before the fall of that leaf they will hatch in the last fortnight of july a cunning rascal that caterpillar said emile it knows the order of the seasons as if it had the almanac by heart i havent told you all another motive acts in determining the butterflys course in laying its eggs on a leaf the insect places them where the young caterpillars are sure to find food close at hand when they come out of the eggs so that they will not have to go running about over the branches a dangerous thing at their tender age all anxiety as to food supply is thus removed at the outset and this assurance against famine is so much to the good in this world of chance and uncertainty whether for men or caterpillars if the butterfly reasoned it all out said jules it couldnt do any better perhaps not so well my child are there not plenty of people alas that show far less foresight the butterfly leaves to its young a leaf as a heritage a leaf to eat whereas the spendthrift the idler leaves to his family nothing but poverty and suffering he has not even the wisdom of an insect caterpillars at table in the latter part of july the eggs hatch and through the covering of down appear here and there little heads pushing aside the fluff that is in their way the first caterpillar hatched out crawls forward and begins to browse on the upper surface of the leaf grazing it lightly and without eating through to the under surface or touching the veins it feeds only on the pulpy matter forming most of the leafs thickness as the hatching continues another little caterpillar advances and takes its place beside the first then a third a fourth and so on until the whole width of the leaf is occupied in this way is formed the first row of browsing caterpillars all with heads in a straight line and leaving in front a certain unoccupied space the next caterpillar to emerge from under the matting of down begins a second row by taking its station at the tail of one of the preceding ones after which others place themselves at the right and left this row completed a third is formed in the same manner and then others so that in a short time the entire surface of the leaf except the forward end is covered with rows of eaters if one leaf is not enough for the whole brood the later comers establish themselves in like order on neighboring leaves there they are then all at table the strictest discipline prevails in this leafy dininghall each caterpillar gnaws what is directly under its mandibles without turning to right or left as that would take from its neighbors share without advancing ahead of its own line as that would mean using the supplies of the future and without falling behind as that would throw the rear ranks into confusion under these conditions a few mouthfuls and no more fall to each caterpillar that is very little for a larvas appetite it must have more but how obtain it scatter abroad on other leaves haphazard undoubtedly there is plenty of room for all on the tree but that would be highly imprudent they must keep together for union is the strength of the weak they must keep together to be able to offer some sort of formidable appearance to their enemies it would be equally objectionable for each to be a law to itself and gnaw where it chose on the same leaf the resulting confusion would cause waste and also it would be very difficult for each to get its proper share some stuffing themselves and others near by dying of hunger in such absence of law and order they would come to blows and fight desperately for a footing on the leaf so that civil war would soon thin their ranks for there is no worse counselor in such emergencies than the stomach order is the only solution of their problem order which safeguards human as well as insect communities what do they do then asked jules we are coming to that each caterpillar as i said gnaws only the spot directly within reach in this way there is left unbrowsed first the part covered by each body and then the forward part of the leaf which is still unoccupied the first row of caterpillars advances one step and finds a second ration in the part thus reached but at the same time it uncovers in the rear a crosswise strip one step wide which the second row now advances to feed upon while in its turn it leaves a similar strip free for the third row and so on one step forward for the whole troop puts each row in possession of the strip left uncovered by the preceding row as for the first row it feeds little by little on the forward part of the leaf designedly left unoccupied in the beginning when step by step the very end of the leaf is reached each caterpillar has gnawed a strip as long and as wide as its own body by that time the first meal is finished you see that with order and economy a hundred and more caterpillars all have a place in the dininghall on the surface of the leaf and all have as nearly equal rations as if these had been allotted by weight and measure animals with their instinct are wonderful creatures uncle observed jules every day brings some fresh surprise it is not the creature itself that is to be wondered at my dear child the marvels it accomplishes are not the fruit of its reflection a grub just out of the egg can have no ideas on method economy coöperation when in order to acquire these ideas man needs the full maturity of his reason our tribute of admiration should be paid to the infinite wisdom which governs the world and leads a brood of caterpillars browsing the surface of a leaf their first hunger appeased the caterpillars construct a shelter from rain and the heat of the sun on its gnawed side the leaf is dryer than on the other and consequently has of itself taken a kind of concave shape by curling up which makes it serve excellently for the floor and walls of the new abode as for the ceiling that is to be of silk from one raised edge of the leaf to the other the caterpillars stretch threads to strengthen their shelter and serve as framework for the roof and finally they weave a fabric on this network of threads thus is erected a tent under which the caterpillars take refuge for the night after roaming over the foliage most of the day feeding sometimes on one leaf sometimes on another thither also they retire when the heat is excessive or the weather threatening it is a shelter hastily constructed and not of enduring quality besides being too small to hold them all so other tents are made of other gnawed leaves and the caterpillars live for a while divided into small families but with the first rainstorms of autumn in september or october a large building is constructed for housing the whole colony through the winter it is a bulky mass of dry leaves and white silk with no definite shape the inside is divided with silk partitions into numerous apartments to which there is access through holes that pierce systematically the several partitions each enclosure thus has its doors which without being directly opposite each other yet provide free circulation in short this common nest though made of extremely fine silk is substantial enough to be proof against wind and weather for the caterpillars use many webs placed one over another and each containing a great number of threads with the coming of the first cold weather all shut themselves up the doors are barricaded with silk and everything is made snug for the winter now let the wind blow and the snow fall curled up together and snuggling against one another the caterpillars sleep the deep sleep produced by the cold lying torpid in their house of silk until the warmth of opening spring awakens them and sends them forth to browse on the growing leaves and dont they eat anything all winter asked emile all winter as well as a part of the autumn and spring they take no food whatever their fast lasts six months and it is an absolute fast that must leave them with very empty stomachs they must be awfully hungry when they wake up so hungry that they make a dash for the tender young leaves and opening flowers and in less than no time strip an orchard bare if the nests are very numerous whole forests are browsed to the last leaf and then to prevent these ravages the mayors notice is heeded some time in the winter these terrible bags of dry leaves and silk are detached from the trees hedges and bushes and the nests with their occupants are burned in spring it would be too late the caterpillars would all have left their quarters enemies of the grapevine one morning jules was sent to the mill to give notice that his uncles wheat was ready to be ground after he had left the village his road ran along beside a vineyard that showed signs of neglect weeds and thistles springing up unchecked nevertheless the vines were pleasing to the eye in the spring freshness of their tender green shoots with their clusters of blossoms still in the bud and their delicate tendrils reaching out for something to cling to here and there leaves of faded and ragged appearance with others that were dried up and shriveled took away somewhat from the general effect but they were not very numerous and jules failed to notice them at first afterward for the last half of the way along the vineyard these withered leaves became so abundant that the young vine shoots looked as if they had been swept by a fire some ravager is at work here said the boy to himself for his eyes were daily becoming more keenly observant lets look into this a little the vines were pitiful to behold their young shoots showing more and more toward the growing end where the grape clusters were forming dried and crumpled leaves some of these being rolled up like cigars under closer scrutiny there was often to be seen an insect with a long beak a weevil of a brilliant metallic green color without question this beautiful weevil was the cause of the mischief insects and cigars especially the former sparkling creatures in the bright light of the sun were soon collected by jules as specimens to take home just then oneeyed john the owner of the vineyard came along what are you doing there he demanded catching a few of these insects that are ruining your vines the boy replied let me see them here they are and you say they are ruining my vines i think so i have just seen some of them making these cigars oh bosh you silly do you think they would take the trouble to make cigars out of leaves they dont smoke its the moon that has burned my vines the moon and so satisfied with his explanation oneeyed john turned on his heel and went off whistling a tune but he would stop whistling when three years later he had to pull up those vines exhausted as they were by the cigarrollers nevertheless he would not take back what he had said the moon had caused all the mischief returning from the mill jules picked up louis on the way and brought him back to share in the benefit of what uncle paul might have to say concerning the specimens jules had collected the insect found on the vine said he after examining one of the brilliant creatures is a weevil you all remember that this name is given to various beetles with a head tapering into a sort of trumpet this one is the rhynchites as entomologists call it or the vinegrub as it is known to vinegrowers it is of a magnificent lustrous green on the back and underneath it shines like gold some darkblue ones are also found but they are more rare the male has on each side of the thorax a little pointed protuberance directed forward the larva is a small white legless worm that begins life in a roll made by the mother with a vine leaf in the month of may she begins operations by cutting the stem of the leaf threequarters through to arrest the flow of sap so that the leaf may wither and be the easier to roll then the weevil rolls it up and lays three or four eggs in its folds when in the process of drying the leaf has assumed the color of tobacco you would take it for a cigar hanging from the vine the young larvæ soon abandon this first shelter let themselves fall and burrow into the ground where they finish developing the vinegrub saps the vigor of the vine by destroying its leaves and therefore the cigarlike rolls should be picked off and burned in may or june in this way the infant insects are destroyed in the cradle and much future damage is prevented along with the shiny green weevil that rolls vine leaves into cigars i found this other insect jules announced displaying the creature that is not a weevil as you can see from the shape of its head which has no tapering beak its wing sheaths are chestnut red the rest of the body being black it is known as the eumolpus or more commonly the vinefretter or in our language the scrivener because in gnawing the surface of the vine leaves it traces fine lines that look somewhat like intricate handwriting it attacks in the same way the stems of grape leaves and of grape clusters the young shoots of the vine and the grapes themselves if the insects are numerous all these incisions and lacerations cause the vines to wither away and produce but little fruit and that of poor quality the larvæ of the vinefretter live in the ground and to destroy them the soil thus infested is turned over in the winter as exposure to the cold kills the grubs when the insects are fully developed it is exceedingly difficult to rid the vines of them at the slightest alarm the little creature busy with its destructive writing on the leaves draws its legs up under its belly and lets itself drop to the ground where it cannot be easily seen because of its dull hue and it also keeps perfectly still playing dead does it think it can escape by not moving asked emile doubtless because then even if it should by any chance be discovered it would probably be mistaken for a grain of earth wouldnt it be better for it to fly away or run away than to play dead its flight is too heavy and its legs too short all insects that cannot take instant flight and are without means of defense do as does the vinefretter in time of danger they remain perfectly motionless nearly always this expedient succeeds with them because their color commonly a dull one causes them to be confounded with the soil ah the sly rogues well then this ruse of the vinefretter must be turned to account by us in our efforts to exterminate the insect under the vine we stretch a cloth after which a sharp blow is given to the main stem the vinefretters let themselves fall they play dead but they can be seen on the cloth and not one escapes the sad fate awaiting it clever mischiefmakers here is another weevil i have to show you began uncle paul the next day what do you think of it note its shiny violet coat with glints of blue that bring out the delicate down with which the whole body is covered the purple of our richest silks is not so magnificent oh the pretty little thing cried emile what can it do with its beautiful clothes nothing to our advantage my boy fine clothes do not make useful citizens either among insects or among men the bees dress is a modest brown and the bee works at honeymaking the dress of the weevil i show you here is very handsome but the elegant creature lives at our expense if you have in your garden any fine plums or pears or apples it gets ahead of you in harvesting the crop it does not even wait for the fruit to ripen so fearful is it of being too late in june it punctures with its pointed snout the young apple or pear or plum and lays an egg in the unripe flesh the fruit thus treated feeds the larva for some time and then dries up and falls off then the worm emigrates leaves the plum that has nourished it and buries itself in the ground to reappear the next spring as a perfect insect i should like to know the name of this plumpricker id teach it to behave if i got hold of it it is called very inappropriately the rhynchites bacchus bacchus if i remember rightly said jules is the god of wine exactly and that is where the word is out of place here no doubt the first observers confounded the weevil of our orchards with that of our vineyards giving to the former the name that should belong to the latter but the mistake has been made and we cant do anything about it now let us keep the names as they are but not confound the two weevils so different in appearance and habits the weevil that rolls the vine leaves is hairless and of a goldengreen color the other is all covered with hairs and its color is a lustrous violet to avoid confusion in our talk why should we not call this latter insect the plumweevil or the pearweevil that would be a good name for it assented louis i shall just call it the plumpricker declared emile there is no reason why you should not his uncle agreed now let us pass on to another member of the family see what widely dissimilar habits there are in a group of insects in which the expert eye can nevertheless perceive close resemblances i might almost say a near relationship some roll grape or oak or poplar leaves others puncture fruit with the beak this one here that i am going to tell you about severspartly never whollythe tips of young and tender shoots of various fruittrees hence they are commonly known as budcutters it is a weevil but much smaller than that of the grapevine the adjective conical is given to it on account of the shape of its thorax or breastplate which tapers a little toward the front like a sugarloaf it is rather lustrous and of a blue color shading into green it shows remarkable cleverness in its operations establishing itself in spring on a pear cherry apricot plum or hawthorn tree indifferently it selects one by one the shoots that suit it and in the not yet unfolded terminal bud it bores with its beak a tiny hole in which it lays an egg but it appears that the young larva requires a diet especially prepared for it one that is slightly decomposed and not the bitter juices of the vigorously growing shoot have not we ourselves similar tastes do we eat medlars and sorbapples just as they come from the tree no indeed they must first be left to ripen on straw even to decay a little then they are firstrate was emiles pronouncement but before that they are horrid that is what the larva of the weevil would say about the shoot on which it has just hatched out before being treated it is bitter it rasps the throat and sets the mandibles on edge after treatment it is delicious yet it doesnt put the branch to ripen on straw as we do medlars no in most cases larvæ show no ingenuity whatever they eat like gluttons and without a thought for anything but eating you know well enough that giving oneself up to gorging is hardly the way to improve the mind for these larvæ then a readymade pap has to be provided as otherwise not knowing how to prepare it themselves they would stupidly starve to death and who prepares the food and makes it just right for them the mother if you please the mother whose great and only occupation it is to provide for the future needs of her unborn young she makes it her business to find for them food that not only has no nourishment in it for herself but which she dislikes she denies herself the enjoyment of flowery fields and summer sunshine to devote all her energies to arduous labors that are of no advantage to her personally and when she has spent her little span of life at this hard task she retires into a corner and dies content the table is set the young larvæ will not lack for food when you see the weevil on a vine leaf sparkling like a precious gem do not think it is there to enjoy itself it is spending itself in the difficult undertaking of sawing the leaf halfway through at the stem after which it will roll the leaf into a sheath to serve as lodging and first food for the larvæ its whole life of two or three weeks is given to this work how can it benefit the insect itself to saw leaf stems and make the leaves wither in the sun and then roll them up in no way whatever the weevil does not eat these leaves or lodge in the sheath made by rolling one of them up it spends its energies in this work solely for the larvæ that are to be hatched out after its death have you ever reflected my children on this perpetual miraclethe miracle of a mother living only for her little ones little ones that she is destined never to see i will not conceal from you that every time i think of this maternal foresight this laborious preparation for a future unknown to the mother herself i feel myself deeply moved the allseeing eye is there in a way peculiar to itself the conical weevil makes ready the pap that is to feed its family the larvæ as i said require the mild juices of a shoot that has been deprived of its natural vigor what does the mother do to put the branch in the proper condition under the spot where the egg is laid she cuts away the bark and some of the wood in a circle with her fine mandibles leaving the shoot supported only by the central portion of the stem the sap no longer circulating beyond this girdle the leaves affected soon wither and the entire tip of the shoot turns black and acquires that state of decay best liked by the newborn grub i knew how to ripen medlars on straw said emile but i should have been puzzled to tell how to ripen a branch of a tree what curious creatures those are with their clever ways of doing things one can do one thing and another can do another and it is always ingenious and never the same it is vexatious that all too often the insects labors involve harm and loss to us when a fruittree has been operated on by the conical weevil you can see in the month of may the tips of the shoots hanging withered and blackened after which they dry up and fall do the larvæ stay in the tips of the fallen branches asked jules what would they do there food would fail them and so they bury themselves in the ground to finish their growth and pass the winter there snugly and safely in the spring their metamorphosis takes place then to guard against insect ravages for the next year said louis the withered shoots that hang from the trees should be collected and burned while the larvæ are still there yes that is the best thing to do nutweevils and flowerweevils ha you rascal ive caught you at it now eating my hazelnuts cried louis one day on seeing a weevil piercing with its long beak a still tender young nut ive caught you at it but first ill learn all about you and then well have a reckoning the weevil was placed in a paper cornucopia together with some pierced hazelnuts and in his first spare moment louis hastened to uncle pauls house his cheeks flushed with excitement little louis was very fond of hazelnuts and to catch in the very act the insect that attacks them was a very serious matter to his thinking in the evening uncle paul had his usual audience around him to listen to his account of the hazelnutweevil here is the little insect louis has caught he began look at its beak a moment what a nose exclaimed emile oh what a nose it is as slender as a hair and very long and turned back at the end doesnt it look as if it were smoking a long pipe as i said the other day asked louis see uncle emile pointed out how close together its eyes are they almost touch each other and the insect seems to be squinting how funny it is with its nose like a pipestem and its squinting eyes where is its mouth asked jules at the very end of what emile calls its long nose his uncle replied how does it manage to eat food must have a hard time getting through that stem not so big around as a thread yes how does it manage to eat emile chimed in i should be in a terrible fix if i had to take my food through a straw as long as myself the weevil is obliged to exercise moderation at the most it drinks with its beak only a few drops of sap from the hazelnuttree it inhabits but if the weevil is temperate in its diet the larva of the weevil eats with a good appetite it demands the whole kernel of a hazelnut and it is on purpose to give the larva this food that the weevil is provided with the long beak that astonishes you the perfect insect i repeat lives much more for its future family than for itself its equipment being designed with reference to the future of its young if the weevil had to think merely of its own food its trumpet would be highly inconvenient but it must above all look out for the wellbeing of its larvæ and to make provision for that the creatures long and slender beak is a wonderful tool serving as a fine gimlet for boring through the nutshell so that the egg may be laid in the very meat itself and the larva be hatched out in the lap of plenty that must be a long hard job for so fine a gimlet jules remarked not at all the tiny mandibles at the end of the trumpet bite the shell almost as easily as an edged tool of steel would do it and moreover the weevil chooses its time it is in may when the hazelnuts are beginning to grow and their shells are soft that the task is undertaken the insect attacks the nut at the base through the green covering called the cup as soon as the hole is made an egg is laid inside the nut and in a week the larva is hatched out it is a legless worm white with a red head as the grub eats very little at first the hazelnut continues to grow and its kernel to ripen though gnawed little by little when august comes the store of provision is exhausted and the wormy nut lies on the ground then the worm its mandibles strong by this time makes a round hole in the empty shell and leaving the nut buries itself in the ground where it undergoes transformation the following spring when i am cracking nuts with my teeth said emile i once in a while bite into something bitter and soft that is the grub of the weevil pah the nasty thing how can i keep the creatures off my hazelnuttrees asked louis that is very simple gather the wormy nuts which sooner or later fall to the ground just as does fruit attacked by insects if they are not pierced with a large hole the worm is still there by burning them you destroy the weevils of the following year but this years weevils will be left no for it is a rule that insects die soon after laying their eggs you havent told us the name of this hazelnuteater said jules it is called the hazelnutbalaninus or hazelnutweevil and you can easily recognize it by its very fine long and recurved beak as also by the yellowishgray down that covers the whole of the insect another balaninus smaller but of the same shape and color lives in acorns in its larva state and is known as the oakbalaninus a third not very often seen around here lives in cherrystones it is the cherrybalaninus how different they all are in their ways of living jules remarked the grainweevil gnaws the kernels of grain the vineweevils and fruitweevils roll leaves or prick pears and plums or cut the buds and now here are the nutweevils that attack the hazelnutmeat the cherrystone and the acorn are there any that eat flowers indeed there are no part of a plant is spared by insects the appletree the peartree and the cherrytree have each its peculiar weevil that in its larva state lives at the expense of the flower buds these ravagers are called by a greek name meaning flowereaters see this appletree weevil the one most familiar to us it is brown with a small white stripe edged with black and placed slantwise on the end of each wing sheath beginning in april it spreads over the appletrees and pierces the flower buds with its fine beak laying an egg in each one a week later the larva is hatched out and immediately the little worm begins to gnaw the flower that is curled up in the bud only the outside covering is left intact by this devourer of course a bud that has had its heart eaten out cannot blossom and so flower and fruit are both lost the damaged buds being gnawed only within keep their shape and take in drying the appearance of cloves those cloves that mother ambroisine puts in stews asked emile the same what are cloves they are as i have already told you 10 the buds or unopened flowers of the clovetree an aromatic bush growing in hot countries they are gathered before opening and are dried in the sun i see why buds pricked by the flowerweevil look like cloves in both cases they are buds that have dried up without opening the larva of the flowerweevil like those of weevils in general is a tiny legless worm white in color it does not leave the bud it has gnawed when this falls from the tree the larva of the nutweevil leaves its nut by boring a hole through the shell that of the conical weevil leaves the fallen shoot the vineweevil lets itself drop out of its rolled leaf and all three bury themselves in the ground to pass the winter in safety and be transformed the following spring the larva of the flowerweevil is more expeditious its change into an insect takes place as soon as it has eaten its bud so that there is no need for it to leave its quarters as animals never do anything without a purpose the grub remains shut up in the dry bud six weeks after the egg is laid the larva emerges transformed into a perfect insect and flits from one appletree to another all summer then comes the winter that must be a trying time said jules many perish but others survive hidden under moss in the cracks of bark or among dry leaves indeed there are plenty of them left to destroy the buds on our appletrees when spring comes the flowerweevil of the peartree and that of the cherrytree resemble the one i have just shown you and their habits are exactly the same it is not easy to get rid of these flowerdestroyers if one had only a few trees to take care of and those easy to get at in every part one could if necessary gather and burn the dry buds inhabited by the larvæ by this painstaking process some of the following years fruit might be saved but not even so should we get rid of all the flowerweevils as these insects fly well and far and they would come from the surrounding region after we had destroyed all our own besides the gathering of injured buds is impracticable on a large scale will these little flowereaters come to be masters of our orchards asked jules will they destroy our apples and pears in the bud and cant we do anything to prevent it they would indeed be masters had we not vigilant guards sharpeyed helpers that from sunrise to sunset lie in wait for insects and hunt them with a patience skill and industry that none of us would be capable of you mean the birds said emile yes the birds when you see on an appletree in bloom a little bird hopping from branch to branch warbling and pecking thank god my children for giving us the charming creature that with every peck of its beak delivers us from an enemy enemies of clover would you like to see another little creature that by reason of its very smallness and its countless numbers braves our wrath and commits ravages that can be checked only by our agricultural helpers the foes of our foes here it is i see it with its long beak cried jules it is another weevil oh how tiny it is exclaimed emile surely it cant eat very much it is small but so numerous that to feed its larvæ it requires whole fields of clover not the entire plant but only the blossom as with the larvæ of the flowerweevil what gluttons they think they must have blossoms tender and sweetsmelling it is the cloverweevil and it measures scarcely three millimeters in length the body of a uniform black is slightly globular behind you know clover well enough with its blossoms massed in a round head well the cloverweevil lays its eggs on the flowerhead before the blossoms open without boring into each flower separately to lay its eggs in jules inquired the weevil does not take that trouble the larvæ must manage for themselves as soon as it is hatched out each one pierces the base of the flower that suits it and works its way inside once there it eats the heart of the bud especially the part that would have become fruit the little pod with its seeds that done it takes on its insect form another weevil equally small and equally numerous runs neck and neck with this one in destroying clover blossoms it is black with yellow legs both abound in cultivated fields in winter they can be found gathered at the foot of trees waiting for the clover to bloom before they go to work you might think these two weevils enough to destroy this useful forage plant but there are others still some larger and some smaller and all eager to get at the poor clover it would almost seem as if insects had agreed to attack especially those plants that are useful to man they set to work by threes by fours by tens and even by hundreds if need be to carry out their ruinous operations some on the flowers others on the roots and still others on the leaves and stems of our most valuable plants the grapevine has its caterpillars beetles and lice wheat feeds destroyers still more numerous and varied such as weevils moths white worms gnats and many others and for the peartree alone we can count five hundred ravagers perhaps more do they want to starve us then jules again inquired what shall i say they go to work in a way to frighten one you ask their motive i will try to show you some other time but now let us finish our talk on the enemies of clover this one here in my hand is known by the learned as the cloverhylast it is a tiny brown beetle with truncated wing sheaths like those of the barkbeetle which it closely resembles in fact it belongs to the same family while the cloverweevil is busy destroying the blossoms this creature stays in the ground and gnaws the roots of the plant we have now the roots the blossoms and the young shoots devoured who will look after the leaves i replies a little beetle with a rounded back and a flattened stomach and called the globular lasia i will do it so that man shall not find anything to mow after we get through with the clover you are familiar with the ladybird or ladybug that little red beetle with tiny black spots on its back the good gods insect never molest it when you find it in the garden it works for us going from one plant to another devouring lice those potbellied creatures that in countless swarms infest the tender shoots of plants and suck the sap the ladybird eats our enemies plantlice it dotes on them do not disturb it the insect known as the globular lasia is of the same family as the ladybird and like the latter it is round and red and has black spots but they are placed differently and usually number about a dozen on each wing sheath the larva is yellow and all bristling with little hairs that stand up like tiny thorns both the larva and the mature insect live not on lice but on leaves whether of clover vetch lucerne or some other plant the marks they make on the gnawed leaves look like furrows made by a fourtoothed comb finally who is to take in hand the stems of the clover this task will fall to various caterpillars equipped with good teeth and strong jaws as for example the glyphic noctua a rather pretty moth with upper wings bearing irregular spots encircled each by a lightgray thread on a brown background and lower wings brightly spotted with a light shade of yellow on every part of the clover on stems and blossoms leaves and roots ravenous devourers are now installed have i exhausted the list by no means there are others in plenty if only to take the leavings of those i have named cabbageeaters one day jacques came in from the garden with a cabbage root all covered with warts having the shape and size of a pea in each wart was a little worm some of the cabbages are withering away announced the old gardener though there are no worms on the leaves i think the trouble comes from the warts on the roots you have guessed right my good jacques replied uncle paul leave me that root and pull up all the cabbages that appear to you to be affected of course you will burn all the diseased roots by so doing you will arrest the evil in the beginning as the insect causing the mischief is rare with us the important thing is not to let it multiply in the garden even if we have to throw away many of the cabbages in exterminating it uncle pauls instructions were followed and no more warty roots have been seen since next day the cabbages enemies were the subject of conversation cultivated plants said uncle paul are more exposed to the ravages of insects than the same plants in a wild state because they are of a finer flavor tenderer and of more luxuriant growth let us first consider the cabbage now that jacques has furnished us the occasion look at this root quite covered with ugly warts hollow inside i open one what do we find within a small worm a larva that would if left undisturbed develop into a weevil with a beak that lies down on the breast between the forelegs when the insect curls up and plays dead this weevil is known to men of science as belonging to a genus called ceuthorhynchus a name formed from two greek words and meaning snouthider it is black with grayish hairs on the back and white scales on the belly its thorax has a deep furrow and its wing sheaths are ornamented with fine parallel grooves it lays its eggs about the beginning of summer the insect works its way down to the root and punctures it here and there with its beak laying an egg in each puncture in flowing around the wounded part the sap of the plant forms a knob or fleshy wart in which the larva grows until the end of october when the worm leaves this nest to bury itself in the ground safe from the cold and undergo transformation the punctured root exhausts its energies in bleeding sap to form the warts occupied by the larvæ so that the cabbage rapidly withers away and in this manner the cabbageweevil makes itself an enemy much to be feared especially in england where it is extremely common nor does it confine its depredations to cabbages it attacks turnips also and radishes and rape this weevil seems to eat a good many things said jules i thought each kind of insect always fed on one particular plant you were not far wrong my boy in most cases insects have very exclusive tastes each confining itself to one kind of plant and disdaining all others sometimes however they vary their diet and as they are connoisseurs very well up on vegetable flavors in changing their food they choose plants having nearly identical nutritive properties taste and smell do not we ourselves find in the radish and the turnip something of the smell and taste of the cabbage thats so assented louis we find more or less similarity in the qualities characteristic of a great many other plants grouped together by botanists in the family of cruciferæ and including for instance the cress the radish and colza botanists cruciferæi dont know very well what those are said emile no those are strange words to you botanists are learned persons who spend their time studying plants and who tell us their names and properties differences and resemblances where they grow and when they blossom with other matters of that sort and cruciferæ that word means crossbearers and is applied to a large group of plants with blossoms having four pieces or petals placed two by two opposite each other so as to form a sort of cross a good example is the colza blossom plants with crossshaped flowers include the cabbage rape turnip radish clove colza cress and many others they are all cruciferæ yes all cruciferæ but their likeness is not confined to the shape of the blossom their inner properties also such as smell taste and the rest are the same or very nearly so consequently the cabbageweevil as knowing a little creature as can be found goes to the turnip when there are no cabbages to be had to the colza if turnips also are lacking or to other plants still but always to some member of the cruciferæ family other insects show this same peculiarity each species having its particular group of plants and going from one to another without ever making a mistake as to family then they are expert botanists i should say jules remarked one might almost think so at least they show in their choice so keen a discernment that often men of science go to school to them to learn the various degrees of relationship in the plant world oh uncle paul you are joking exclaimed jules joking listen you know the nasturtium that beautiful orangecolored flower ending at the bottom in a kind of horn and you know the mignonette that sweetsmelling plant that mother ambroisine grows in the window yes i know them then tell me whether you find between mignonette nasturtium and cabbage any resemblance any sign of plantrelationship no indeed those three plants are wholly unlike one another their flowers havent the same shape nor their leaves nor yet their fruit well my dear boy you who rather pride yourself on knowing something about flowers really know much less about them than a poor little green caterpillar very common in our gardens and many persons of far more learning than you could take lessons from this same caterpillar it feeds indifferently on various cruciferæ such as the cabbage rape and the turnip but it also feeds on the nasturtium and the mignonette why you must ask the scientists who make a thorough study of plants and are determined to find out the minutest details concerning them they would tell you that there is something in their innermost structure something invisible to our untrained eyes that makes the nasturtium and the mignonette very nearly akin to the cruciferæ without looking like them it is enough to puzzle anybody i admit a worthless caterpillar has from the beginning of the world eaten mignonette as well as turnip cabbage as well as nasturtium and has been familiar with plantrelationships unsuspected by science until our own time i should like to see this caterpillar that knows so much about plants your desire shall be gratified without delay a destructive family they went out to the garden and uncle paul hunted for some time in the cabbage bed before he found what he wanted here is the caterpillar we were talking about he announced at last it is of a delicate green color with three yellow stripes running lengthwise now you must make the acquaintance of the butterfly jules go and bring me the net uncle paul had a large gauze net the mouth of which was attached to a hoop of coarse iron wire fastened to the end of a long stick that was his butterflynet and in his leisure moments he used it for catching butterflies that he might destroy them before they laid their eggs on the plants in the garden the more butterflies destroyed the fewer hundreds of caterpillars a little later jules came back with the net but the chase did not accomplish the desired result though another butterfly was caught very much like the one they were after we must be content with this said uncle paul my butterflyhunting of the last few days seems to have left us none of the sort i am looking for so we will not waste any more time the insect i have just caught is known as the cabbagebutterfly its wings are white the forward ones having black tips and two or three spots of the same color in the middle i see that butterfly everywhere declared emile it is in fact one of the most widely prevalent species its caterpillar is greenish marked with black dots and three longitudinal yellow stripes it does not spin a cocoon for its metamorphosis the chrysalis is spotted with yellow and black and is found near where the caterpillar lived suspended from a wall or a tree in a very ingenious manner before shedding its skin the caterpillar emits its small supply of liquid silk gluing the end of its tail to the spot it has selected and then spinning a fine band which it passes across its body fastening the two ends at right and left on the stone or the bark to which it is clinging these preliminaries concluded the chrysalis stage is reached the chrysalis being held firmly in place with its lower end glued to the supporting object and its upper half kept from falling by the silk band without any cocoon to protect it asked emile without any cocoon whatever hence it is called a naked chrysalis many other caterpillars adopt the same method having only a scanty little drop of liquid silk much too small a quantity for spinning a cocoon they content themselves when their metamorphosis approaches with gluing their tail to some object and supporting themselves further with a narrow band it is to be noted that butterflies from caterpillars that do not spin cocoons all have very slender antennæ ending abruptly in a rounded protuberance or swelling and that they fly by day in the brightest sunshine they are butterflies proper as distinguished from moths these latter have the chrysalis enclosed in a cocoon and their antennæ are sometimes of a feathery appearance sometimes spindleshaped or they may take the form of elongated clubs or finally they may be threadlike tapering but little toward the end they fly mostly in the evening twilight or even in the night compare the antennæ of the cabbagebutterfly with those of the silkwormmoth or the leopardmoth and you will see how easy it is to distinguish a butterfly from a moth a cocoonless from a cocoonspinning insect then thats all you have to dojust see whether the antennæ end in a little round swelling said jules with something on the antennæ repeated emile no cocoon without that a cocoon how easy it is as the youngest and giddiest of my hearers has understood my explanation so well i will pass on let us return to the butterfly whose caterpillar is so interesting to jules because it eats indifferently cabbages turnips radishes nasturtiums and mignonette this butterfly is very much like the cabbagebutterfly it too is white with black spots on the forward wings but not of so deep a shade furthermore it is about a third smaller it is called the radishbutterfly to distinguish these two species so much alike in coloring and both feeding on the same plants gardeners call the former the big cabbagebutterfly and the latter the little cabbagebutterfly i know those butterflies jules interposed many a time ive seen both kinds on the flowers in the garden and i got them mixed because there is hardly any difference in their color now i shall know how to tell them apart the larger one is the cabbagebutterfly the smaller the radishbutterfly you must bear in mind that the words cabbage and radish used to designate the two butterflies do not mean that the caterpillar of the one eats exclusively cabbages and that of the other only radishes as a matter of fact the names could be reversed without any impropriety for both caterpillars as occasion offers feed on either the cabbage the radish the turnip or some other cruciferous plant but let it be noted also that these two terms have been chosen as substantially true to the facts though likely to mislead if taken in too literal a sense the same remark applies to a third species the turnipbutterfly whose caterpillar feeds not only on the leaves of turnip plants but also on those of the nasturtium the mignonette the radish cabbage and many other crucifers it is of about the size of the radishbutterfly and its wings are white with greenish veins underneath the forward wings have also black spots on their upper surfaces the caterpillar is slightly hairy and of a uniform green color with no yellow stripes running lengthwise fliers with wings of gauze questioned as to the means to be adopted in order to protect from their insect enemies the various plants he had mentioned in his last talk uncle paul was forced to acknowledge the inadequacy of any preventive measures at our command for protecting a few square yards of cabbagepatch from these devourers he explained a rigorous search for worms and an incessant chase after butterflies on that particular piece of land might prove effective but how keep watch over acres and acres with butterflies and moths of many kinds flying all about and alighting every moment to lay their eggs the cost of any such watchfulness would far exceed the value of the crop and so it is in general with all raising of farm products on a large scale when once the enemy is in possession it is all but impossible to drive him out if we depend on our own resources however much we may spend in the attempt because of their infinite numbers the insects always have the advantage of us but fortunately there are others fighting for us and they wage valiant warfare against our insect foes especially against worms and caterpillars you mean the birds asked jules yes and other equally useful helpers that you have never heard of notwithstanding the immense service they render us i refer to the insects belonging to the order known as hymenoptera hymenoptera ive never heard that word before and for that reason i hasten to explain its meaning to you you are familiar with the honeybee the bumblebee and the wasp like butterflies they have four wings for flying but these wings instead of being covered with scalesthose scales that come off on your hand and look like dustare simply membranes of a transparent or gauzy appearance hence the name hymenoptera that is given to these insects a latin name that may be translated as membranouswinged creatures furthermore they have at the end of the abdomen a very fine sting which comes out of its sheath when the irritated insect seeks to defend itself by pricking the venturesome fingers that have seized it in other species this sting is represented sometimes by a kind of saw or cutlass sometimes by a blade more or less long and slender hidden in a fold of the stomach or else projecting and open to view well insects thus armed with a sting a saw or a blade and having four membranous wings as fine and transparent as those of the honeybee the bumblebee and the wasp are called hymenoptera they form an order just as butterflies and moths form the order of lepidoptera and insects with sheaths protecting the lower pair of wings form the order of coleoptera the grasshopper jules observed has a kind of sword on the end of its body but it hasnt the bees fine transparent wings therefore it is not one of the hymenoptera the grasshopper doesnt hurt any one with its sword does it asked emile no it uses this tool simply for placing its eggs in the ground where they are to hatch it is a sort of conveyor for the eggs and is called a terebra the saw the blade the cutlass and other like implements that terminate the body of various insects have also this name they serve to deposit the eggs in suitable places where the larvæ can find food but this implement dangerous though it looks never stings when the insect is molested it is not a defensive weapon only the honeybee the bumblebee the wasp and some others have for their defense a sting that inflicts a painful wound so painful emile interrupted that i still remember how once when i wanted to see what was going on in the beehive i was stung by the bees the wasps sting is much worse remarked louis when i was gathering the grapes last year i took hold of a bunch where there were some wasps and my hand was swollen all day and pained me so i should have cried if there had been nobody around how wonderful that such small creatures really hurt like that jules exclaimed i should like to know why i will tell you the sting of these insects is a slender lancet hard and sharppointed a kind of dagger finer than the finest needle it is situated at the end of the abdomen in repose it is not seen being concealed in a sort of scabbard let into the creatures body but in time of danger it comes out of this scabbard now it is not exactly the wound made by the sting that causes the smarting pain you know so well this wound is so slight so subtle that we cannot see it and we should hardly feel it if it were made by a needle or a thorn as fine as the sting but the sting communicates with a venomsac lodged in the insects body and through a tiny channel running the length of the sting there is injected into the very heart of the wound a minute quantity of a highly dangerous liquid after this injection the sting is withdrawn while the venom remains in the wound and that is what causes the pain learned men who have studied this curious subject relate the following experiment which was performed in order to prove that it is the venomous liquid introduced into the wound and not the wound itself that causes the pain when one pricks oneself with a very fine needle the pain is of no consequence and passes almost immediately well the prick of a needle insignificant in itself can be made very painful indeed if the little wound is poisoned with venom from a bee or a wasp the learned men i just spoke of dipped the point of a needle into the bees venomsac and with the needle thus moistened lightly pricked themselves the pain that followed was severe and protracted even severer and of longer duration than if the insect itself had stung the experimenters this difference is to be explained by the fact that the needle large in comparison with the insects sting introduced into the wound much more venom than the sting itself could have conveyed now you understand i hope that it is the injection of the venom into the wound that causes all the mischief that is plain enough assented jules the bees sting is barbed continued uncle paul that is to say it is furnished with teeth somewhat like those of a saw and pointing backward in its haste to fly away after stinging the bee does not always succeed on account of these teeth in drawing out the sting from the wound it has inflicted and thus the sting is wrenched from the bees body to the endangering of the insects life the venomsac is left behind also it is that little white globule one sees outside the wound and at the base of the sting if the person stung hastening to extract the sting is awkward enough to press on the little sac a great part of the venom is likely to be injected into the wound with a corresponding increase of pain this is a warning to you whenever you are stung by a bee to draw out the sting cautiously and to be careful not to press on the venomsac beneficent parasites continuing the subject of the day before uncle paul laid emphasis on the distinction between those hymenopterous insects that sting and those that do not at the end of the abdomen said he the one class have a poisoned weapon for selfdefense as in bees and wasps while the other class are furnished simply with the implement called a terebra sometimes concealed in a fold of the skin sometimes standing out in full view and used not for stinging but for introducing the creatures eggs into such places as will provide the nourishment required by the future brood insects of this latter class are called by the general name of ichneumons this morning emile caught one which i will show you i found it on a flower said emile and i wrapped a handkerchief round my hand for fear of being stung the thing it has sticking out at the end of its body looks rather dangerous the precaution was needless his uncle assured him no ichneumon however long its terebra may be can sting your hand the hymenopters that are to be feared have their sting hidden and they bring it out only at the moment of attack those three threadlike things as long as the insects bodywhat are they for asked jules the two lateral ones unite and form a scabbard for holding and protecting the middle one the most important of the three for it is used to deposit the eggs at the point chosen as suitable by the insect ive seen ichneumons very much like this one said louis with the terebra stuck right into the thick bark of a poplar they must have been laying their eggs in the wood under the bark no they were doing something better than that the larvæ of ichneumons live in the bodies of other larvæ which they devour little by little without killing them until the very last they are carnivorous larvæ they must have fresh meat that is renewed about as fast as they eat it the ichneumons louis speaks of were engaged in depositing their eggs in the bodies of plump worms that live in the wood of the tree and turn into beetles but these beetleworms jules pointed out were not in sight they were under the bark and perhaps in the wood itself the ichneumon does not need to see them to know where they are does it hear them then no more than it sees them the worm stays quietly in its little tunnel being careful not to make any noise that will attract the attention of its enemy then the ichneumon must at least smell them that is very doubtful a live larva has no odor and besides the most difficult part is not to find out whether or not a suitably plump larva is there under the bark at such and such a depth it is also necessary to ascertain whether another ichneumon egg has not already been laid in the body of the coveted worm as one larva would be insufficient for two nurslings an egg deposited in some fat worm is not seen heard or felt that is very evident nevertheless the ichneumon never plunges its terebra through the bark into a larva already occupied what guides it i do not know nobody knows instinct has ways and means unsuspected by our wisdom an ichneumon alights on the trunk of a tree the perfectly healthy bark betrays to the sharpest eyes no sign of what the hymenopter is after never mind the insect soon satisfies itself as to whether or not the place is a good one for its purpose it makes a careful examination tapping with its antennæ and keeping up a continual vibratory movement a spot is chosen the insect plants itself firmly on its legs draws up its abdomen and holding its terebra in a vertical position plunges the point of it into an imperceptible fissure in the bark the little auger pierces the bark though not without effort and occasional pauses for there are difficulties to be overcome nevertheless it goes as far as its length permits the end is attained the point of the instrument penetrates the flesh of the worm hidden under the bark the egg being deposited in the incision thus made the insect withdraws its blade carefully so as not to break it and proceeds to lay eggs in the bodies of other larvæ then the great length of this blade jules remarked though at first it seems unhandy for the creature is on the contrary perfectly fitted for the work to be done with too short a terebra the ichneumon couldnt reach the larvæ under the bark and even in the wood itself from the length of the terebra one can estimate at what depth as a rule the eggs are laid ichneumons with a long terebra lay their eggs in larvæ protected by a thick layer of bark or wood or earth or other material those with a short terebra seek larvæ living in the open air such as caterpillars for example however if the caterpillar is covered with long hairs thus keeping the ichneumon at a distance from the skin of its victim a long implement is still necessary to convey the eggs into the flesh but for smoothskinned caterpillars without any defense the ichneumon is furnished with a very short terebra often invisible when not in action so that the end of the insects abdomen must be pressed in order to make the eggconveyer show itself be it lancet saw fine blade or other instrument of that sort the ichneumon on the hunt is one of the most curious sights imaginable caterpillars are peacefully browsing on leaves an ichneumon comes along flies about over them selects the ones that look best for its purpose and never fails to exclude those that already have eggs in their bodies at the sound of their enemys wings the terrified caterpillars stop eating and begin to move their heads in a startled manner from side to side doubtless in the hope of frightening off the foe but the latter pays no attention to these vain threats it alights on the caterpillar of its choice and so quickly that you hardly have time to see the operation darts its terebra and lays an egg in the wound and doesnt the caterpillar make any resistance asked emile it performs some lively antics but that is all the poor creature cannot defend itself against an enemy in the air a winged enemy that can always keep at a safe distance and is always ready to fly away the other eligible caterpillars in the group are attacked in the same manner one by one until the ichneumon has laid all its eggs each caterpillar gets only one egg asked jules that depends on the size of the egglayer if it is large it lays but one egg in each caterpillar so that the larvæ may each have enough food if small it lays several and then what happens emile inquired the ichneumon gone the pricked caterpillars soon recover their composure and resume their eating the prick not being poisoned with venom causes very little pain besides it would take a good deal more than that to affect their appetites all goes well for a few days as long as the eggs are unhatched do those eggs hatch in the caterpillars body yes and as soon as they have hatched do the little larvæ set to work devouring the caterpillars inside thats the way of it what an awful stomachache for the poor caterpillars nevertheless even with such pain as may result from the gradual consumption of their flesh the caterpillars continue to eat as if nothing had happened the satisfaction of their appetite making them forget their sufferings so imperious is their need of food and furthermore for a reason that i will explain the parasitic worms observe a certain caution in their ravages in the body of every animal are certain organs more indispensable than others for the maintenance of life and if they are injured even though slightly death follows such are the heart and brain in the higher animals in a caterpillars body there are it is true no heart or brain like those of animals higher in the scale but there are analogous organs just as necessary to the ongoing of the vital functions if the ichneumons larvæ in eating their victims flesh were to injure these vital organs the caterpillar would quickly die and the larvæ would perish too for they must have fresh meat not decayed flesh it is a question of life or death to them whether the grubs avoid biting in the wrong place or not the caterpillar must live in order that they may live it must prolong its miserable existence until they are ready for their metamorphosis so the little parasites scrupulously respect any organ indispensable to the maintenance of life and feed on the rest guided by instinct they distinguish admirably between what they may attack and what they must let alone a time comes however when because of their approaching transformation they do not need to exercise further selfrestraint and they accordingly devour the parts until then left intact thereupon the caterpillar dies being reduced to an empty skin which the larvæ promptly abandon in order to spin their cocoons and turn into nymphs and finally into ichneumons sometimes the caterpillar is spared until it has shut itself up in a case and turned into a chrysalis with the result that the larvæ inhabiting the caterpillar find themselves without any labor on their part provided with snug quarters for the winter out of every such wormy chrysalis consumed to the skin there emerges in the spring not a butterfly but a swarm of ichneumons last autumn said jules i found in the garden a large brown cocoon and i hoped to see a beautiful butterfly come out of it but this spring to my great astonishment out came a swarm of little flies what you took for flies was a brood of ichneumons yet there are flies real flies that lay their eggs in the bodies of caterpillars just as the hymenopterous butterflies do with their terebra with their strange way of living on other creatures observed louis ichneumons must destroy lots of caterpillars they destroy so many that often if you take a hundred caterpillars haphazard from cabbages or other growing vegetables you will find not more than two or three that are sound and in a condition to undergo metamorphosis can those that have eggs in them be told from the rest asked louis easily the point pierced by the ichneumons terebra is surrounded by a little black spot when you are gathering caterpillars it is well not to crush those that you see are pricked nor yet those that look diseased and have a loose skin they are ichneumonfeeders and their preservation means so many more swarms of ichneumons the next summer for the destruction of caterpillars appleeaters please tell us about the worm we find in apples and pears was louiss request one day when the children were gathered about their uncle that worm my lad he began as i have already briefly explained is the grub or larva of a small moth seems to me interrupted jules the moth is responsible for a good deal of mischief yes moths do more harm than any other insects but not as moths for these never give us any cause for complaint being content to suck a little honey through their slender trumpet from the flowers growing on every side it is in the larva state with appetites of the most varied sort that they commit their ravages i have already told you about worms that gnaw wood and those that eat woolen stuffs those that browse the foliage and those that attack roots now we come to some that give their attention to fruit the bestknown of these is the worm that lives in apples and pears we usually call it the appleworm and its moth is known as the applepyralis the term pyralis is new to you it comes from a greek word meaning fire and was long ago ignorantly applied to the applemoth because that insect was supposed to eat fire as its regular diet its forward wings are ashgray streaked crosswise with brown and ornamented at the tip with a large red spot encircled by a goldenred border the rear wings are brown when the fruit is just beginning to form the pyralis lays an egg in the blossom end of apple or pear no matter which and the little worm that soon comes from this egg takes up its abode close to the seeds the narrow channel by which it entered skins over so that the wormy fruit appears intact for some time meanwhile the worm is living in the lap of luxury with an abundance of its favorite food all around but it must have a passage communicating with the outside so as to get air and make the abode sanitary encumbered as it is with refuse and excrement accordingly the worm bores a little tunnel through the flesh of the fruit to the skin and through this also there the tunnel ends in a round hole through this passageway the larva receives fresh air and throws out from time to time the chewed and digested pulp in the form familiar to us as reddish wormhole dust the translucent quality of its skin causes the worm to vary in hue according to the color of what it eats being sometimes white sometimes brown or yellow and sometimes pink it is ornamented with little black tubercles or pimples arranged in pairs the head and the first ringlike section of the body are brown apples and pears containing worms continue to grow indeed they ripen sooner than the others but it is a sickly maturity that hastens the fall of the fruit as a rule the larva in wormy fruit that has fallen to the ground is by that time fully grown accordingly it leaves its domicile by the passage already made and creeps into some crevice in the bark of a tree or sometimes it retires underground after which it makes for itself a shell of silk mixed with fragments of wood or dead leaves and turns into a moth the next year when all the young apples and pears are ready to receive its eggs for the new generation in plums and apricots is found a worm closely resembling that infesting apples and pears another occurs in chestnuts and a third in peapods the tender young peas furnishing excellent food for the intruder all these worms are the larvæ of moths commonly named from the fruit or vegetable they infest the peaworm after it has devoured the best part of the pods contents passes into another pod by boring a round hole its moth appears in june and the larva in july and august consequently spring peas are never wormy while those of late summer very often are this example shows you how in certain instances a crop can be saved by hastening or delaying the sowing according to the time when the ravagers may be expected to appear but no such plan can be carried out with chestnuts said emile that is plain enough for chestnuttrees bear their nuts at a fixed time and we cant hurry them up or keep them back the chestnutmoth comes just when the table is set for its young ones what disgustinglooking worms they are tooall red and soaked in their own juice in the chestnutmeat we cant do anything either for the appletrees and the peartrees can we louis inquired not much some people gather the wormy apples and pears fallen from or still on the trees and crush them to kill the worms inside that makes so many enemies the fewer for the following year but again it has to be admitted that left to our own resources we could never defend ourselves against the pyralis and other similar moths that produce larvæ from which hardly anything is safe fortunately the swallow catches these moths on the wing bats chase them assiduously in the twilight and the little gray lizard snaps them up when they alight on the trunks of trees these are so many friends protectors of our gardens and orchards the moths you call by that queer name pyralisare there a good many of them asked jules there are numerous species and each species is represented by countless legions of individual moths some of these attack fruit i have just told you about the principal ones others have a different mode of life and of these i will speak tomorrow but they are all very small moths and some are beautifully colored their antennæ are fine and their wings rounding at the shoulders spread out in the form of a cape and are folded together in repose like the two halves of a sloping roof that is they incline to right and left their grubs have a smooth and shiny skin these worms draw back quickly when molested and let themselves fall to the ground deadening the shock of the fall by means of a silk thread that holds them suspended by the lip thats a clever trick emile observed as soon as the worm is frightened it glues the end of the thread to something and down it drops but gently and only as fast as the thread is let out by the spinneret this morning said jules mother ambroisine was picking over some dried peas a few were pierced with a round hole and others had a little brown insect spotted with white peas then have two enemies the pyralisworm that eats fresh fruit and the insect i am speaking of that eats them dry the insect that eats dried peas is a small beetle a weevil with a wide and very short snout it is known as the peaweevil another weevil eats beans and still another lentils it is always the larva that does the mischief once arrived at the perfect state the weevil bores a round hole in the seed and gets out these weevils have the same habits as the grainweevil they are destroyed by the use of sulphide of carbon or simply by the action of heat if the seeds they infest are not to be sown for the temperature required to kill the insects and their larvæ would also destroy the germinative principle of the seed chapter l leafrollers many of the moths bearing the name of pyralis have a curious habit in their larva state of rolling up the leaves of trees or of folding them lengthwise or of uniting several in the form of a sheath by means of silk threads so as to make a shelter in which they may nibble away in safety at the interior of their green abode for this reason they are called leafrollers the one best known on account of the damage it does is the grapevinepyralis it is a small moth with yellow wings having the metallic sheen of copper and crossed by brown stripes its larva is greenish bristling with short hairs and having a head of a dark lustrous green color in august the moth lays its eggs on the vine leaves in little slabs of twenty at most hatching takes place in september at this advanced season of the year caterpillars do not eat they suspend themselves by a thread and wait for the wind to drive them against the vine or one of its supports as soon as they get a foothold on the desired object they take refuge in cracks in the bark and fissures in the wood and there they lie torpid through the winter at the reawakening of vegetable life and the first pushing forth of the new vine shoots they leave their winter quarters invade the vines and entwine with silk threads the young grape clusters and the tender leaves after which they feed upon them with an appetite sharpened by a fast of five or six months with such ravenous eaters devastation proceeds apace and in a few weeks if the worms are numerous the most flourishing vine is reduced to a pitiful condition and all hope of a harvest is abandoned the ravages wrought by this moth between 1835 and 1840 in the vineyards of bourgogne will long be remembered over immense tracts of land when vintagetime came there was not a single bunch of grapes to go into the basket the greedy caterpillars ruined the country didnt the people try to get rid of the creatures asked louis they tried various methods but with little success until finally one proved effective and that the simplest and cheapest of all let us note by the way my little friends what an advantage it is to be acquainted with the habits of an insect that does us harm if this moths peculiarities had not been studied if it had not been known that its larvæ hide themselves in the fissures of the vines and the trellises there to lie torpid all winter our vineyards might still be suffering from this terrible enemy this fact being known the remedy was not far to seek it is this in winter the vines and trellises are scalded with boiling water the water being heated over a fire in the middle of the vineyard with a coffeepot about a liter of hot water is poured on each vine so as to reach all the parts where worms may be lurking protected by its tough bark the vine itself does not suffer from this scalding bath while the caterpillars are completely destroyed by this method the vineyards of bourgogne were so entirely rid of the dreaded moth that no further ravages of any account have been reported couldnt the moths come back again some time as many as ever asked jules that is hardly possible if at their first appearance the coffeepot of hot water is brought into play the other leafrolling moths of this family are of less importance the leafroller of the plumtree lives first on the blossoms of the tree later it makes a roll of leaves and lines it with silk the moth has a large white spot at the tip of each fore wing the cherrytree leafroller has about the same habits its moth is recognized by two wide oblique stripes of the color of rust on its fore wings on the peartree lives a leafroller with a triangular white spot in the middle of each fore wing i dont remember ever having seen the moths you are telling us about said jules they are too small to be noticed by any one who is not on the lookout for them i have often seen the nests of leafrolling caterpillars on fruittrees and bushes and all sorts of plants there are leaves folded lengthwise so that the edges join and make a sort of tunnel others are in twos or threes or more and there are some fastened together in a big bunch all twisted and ragged with silk threads holding them together on opening these nests of leaves and silk i have sometimes found a caterpillar and sometimes a spider various spiders with too little silk to spin a large web for catching flies make an ambush by bringing the edges of two or three adjacent leaves together like the leafrolling caterpillars they use silk threads to hold the pieces of their abode in place but their ultimate object is quite different the rollers bring the leaves together so as to nibble them in peace safely hidden away in the shelter thus formed the spiders bring them together to make a simple abode for themselves and an ambush from which they can pounce upon such insects as come within their reach the spiders that make a nest of leaves joined together do not harm trees i should rather say they are helpful to trees they are vigilant guardians always on the watch for flies gnats little moths and other ravagers that would come and infest the trees with their eggs chapter li the hopmoth what is that pretty butterfly in your box next to the pyralis emile asked his uncle when the latter was showing the children some of his specimens of moths and butterflies it has silver wings bordered with red that is not a butterfly my boy replied uncle paul it is a moth that infests hopvines are hops those things they make beer with beer is not made from hops my boy it is made from barley first the barley is slightly moistened after which it is kept at a mild temperature the grain begins to sprout just as it would do if sown in the field for the nourishment of the little plants which have no roots as yet a special food already prepared is needed just as the young kitten not yet big enough to catch mice needs its mothers milk all grain in beginning to grow whether it be wheat or oats or rye or any other requires a special form of nourishment ready prepared but where do you suppose it is to be found you hadnt thought of that i will tell you the grain has it in itself in a kernel of barley or wheat or oats or rye there is a white substance which when ground to powder is known as flour then the sprouting plant feeds on flour not exactly flour is too coarse a food for it the little plant takes its nourishment much as we do when we are very small it sucks up water holding in solution the substances needed for its growth but flour will not dissolve in water as you very well know consequently the little plant would die of hunger right beside its store of provision if the flour were not prepared for iti might say cooked for itin a way suited to its needs that must be a funny arrangementfood cooked for a plant it is more wonderful than you can imagine as the sprout pushes upward the flour in the grain is being turned to sugar real sugar very sweet and easily dissolved in water so that the young plant has for its nourishment a sufficient supply of sweetened water or to express it in another way a sort of milk oh yes cried emile now i understand last christmas mother ambroisine put some wheat to sprout in a plate and kept it moist on the mantelpiece when the little blades began to show the wheat was all soft and would crush under your fingers and it gave out a sort of very sweet milk this wonderful transformation of flour into sugar during germination is turned to account by man in making beer he causes barley to germinate and when he judges that all the flour substance it contains has turned to sugar he quickly kills the little plants as otherwise the sweetened liquid would be taken up by them and would undergo another transformation by being turned into plant substance accordingly the grain is promptly dried in an oven after which it is ground in a mill and this ground barley is called malt by adding water and keeping it at a mild temperature we induce a fresh change the sugar turns to alcohol which is the essential element of beer and wine the flour of the grain then said jules turns to sugar or to plant substance or to alcohol according to the way it is treated is that it yes and it can be converted into many other things boiled with water it becomes paste after entering into the composition of beer it can be turned into vinegar by being left exposed to the air and allowed to sour but we will not now dwell on these various changes let us return to the subject of beer in order to impart to that beverage the bitter taste and the aroma peculiar to it we use hops barley is the fundamental ingredient of the drink hops are the flavoring the hopplant is a long slender vine unable to hold itself up without supporting poles around which it twines to the height of perhaps ten meters its leaves are lobed somewhat like those of the grape and its fruit takes the shape of cones or catkins similar to those of the pinetree but much smaller and composed of thin scales coated with a sort of bitter resin it is these cones that are used in making beer hops are extensively cultivated in alsace and in germany the chief enemies of the hopvine are two worms one of which nibbles the roots and the other the inside of the stem or vine the epialidæ are distinguished from all other moths by their very short antennæ their larvæ live in the ground and feed on roots the most important member of this family is the hopmoth of which the male has white wings touched with silver and edged with a reddish border and the female has fore wings of bright yellow with tawny edges and two tawny oblique stripes the grub is whitish covered with little yellow tubercles overgrown with black hair it does great damage to hop plantations by gnawing the roots to destroy it the hopgrower is advised to spray the base of the vine with water in which hogmanure has been left to steepan application that is said to kill the worms within the stem of the plant lives the grub of the pyralis that i show you here the moth has darkyellow fore wings edged with a scalloped stripe of a lighter shade and marked with a number of red spots the hind wings are white with purple spots and yellowish edges alongside of that moth there are two more in your box emile pointed out they are the maddermoth and the woadmoth madder used to be cultivated for its root which yields a red dye the most beautiful and lasting of all red dyes isnt mother ambroisines sunday kerchief dyed with madder yes and with the red there are black pink garnet and violet on the kerchief all obtained from madder in the methods formerly in use various drugs were first applied to the goods to be dyed this being done by means of wooden blocks engraved with the desired patterns after which a bath of boiling water containing powdered madder root brought out all the different colors at once their respective tints depending on the drugs previously applied these colors of which there were many varieties had the great advantage of never fading in the sun and of resisting soap hence madder used to be the most highly prized of dyestuffs and was a source of much profit to alsace and the department of vaucluse the only districts devoted to its culture its insect foe was the moth i now show you at weedingtime it was the custom to destroy the caterpillars which fed on the leaves of the plant woad is another plant used in dyeing prepared in a certain way the green matter of its leaves gives a fine blue color the caterpillar of a leafrolling moth eats first the woad leaves and then the stalk chapter lii the inchworm one day uncle paul was in his garden engaged in an operation on his peartrees that greatly puzzled emile and jules he had a pot of black sticky stuff with a strong smell and was smearing it with a brush all around the base of the trees oh how oneeyed john would have laughed if he had peeped through the hedge and seen uncle paul daubing the foot of his peartrees with black but he would have been greatly in the wrong as is proved by what the boys uncle said to them that same evening what do you call that stuff you were putting on the trees this morning jules inquired it is called tar and is a substance derived from coal to make illuminating gas coal is put into large castiron vessels and heated redhot all outside air being excluded meanwhile the heat decomposes the coal which cannot burn for want of air the products of this decomposition are illuminating gas tar and coke this last being a kind of coal of metallic appearance very porous and light the gas and the tar are drawn off through a pipe the coke remaining in the castiron vessel tar is a very black sticky substance with a strong odor repugnant to insects then you put a coating of it around the tree trunks to keep off insects certain moths whose caterpillars i fear came through my hedge the girdle of tar put on at the base of the trunk is to prevent their climbing to the branches to lay their eggs in that way i protect the fruittrees from the caterpillars that a little later would destroy the foliage but moths can fly well enough and your tar wouldnt stop them if they cant reach the branches by climbing the trunk they will fly up to them for a moth that flies agreed if on the contrary it cannot fly but has to content itself with walking is it not true that the coating of tar encircling the foot of the tree trunk will prove an impassable obstacle in the first place the smell of tar is offensive to the moth and then if it ventures on the sticky girdle it will infallibly become entangled and die stuck fast in the tar that is plain assented louis but are there any moths that cant fly there are are the lazy things afraid to use their wings asked emile perhaps they think its too much trouble how could they use them they havent any to use poor things that accounts for it then moths without wings yes my boy moths without wings you shall see some this one is called by learned men phalæna geometra which means geometermoth you will soon see why it is so named but it has wings magnificent ones all dotted with brown spots on a yellowish background yes and i will add that the forward ones have dark stripes now what do you think of this other moth that ugly thing isnt a moth you judge by appearances my dear child and not by reality this ungainly creature laboriously dragging along its big naked yellowish abdomen with large black spots is the female of the other moth i should never have guessed it neither you nor a great many others henceforth you will know that there are numerous species of moths whose females are either wingless or equipped with such mere stumps of wings that they are unable to fly whereas the males invariably have welldeveloped wings now the male is not the one to be feared it is the female with her eggs the office of the tar girdle at the foot of the tree is to arrest the moth when it tries to climb to the branches where the laying takes place repulsed by the odor it turns back or if it persists in its endeavors to pass it sticks to the tar and so perishes if the female laid her eggs somewhere else suggested jules instead of on the branchesfor instance on the groundwouldnt the caterpillars know enough to climb the trees by themselves the tar barrier would still be there to stop them besides caterpillars hatched on the ground would hardly think of climbing the tree to the place where in the usual order the hatching would have taken place as long as the customary conditions remain unaltered insects show an astonishing instinct beyond these conditions they do not know how to act the caterpillar of the geometermoth is gray with a yellow stripe running lengthwise on each side it has a curious way of walking common to it and other caterpillars of the same group these caterpillars are long and cylindrical in shape and they usually have but two pairs of false legs at some distance from the true front legs in walking they first rest themselves on the forward legs and then bring up the others by curving the body into a loop or ring the next movement is to raise the forward legs and advance them in a stride as long as the creature itself after which the body again bends into a loop by the bringing up of the hind legs as before these peculiar strides give the worm the appearance of a pair of dividers getting over the ground by alternately opening and closing its two legs you might say the creature surveys or measures the road it travels and that is why its moth is known as the geometermoth the common name of inchworm applied to the caterpillar is familiar to you as referring to the caterpillars length further characteristics are to be noted clinging to the branch solely by their hind creepers these worms remain for hours in the strangest postures the body stiff and motionless you will see some stretched out straight some turned up behind some arched in a semicircular position not one moves not one shows weariness in these uncomfortable attitudes which demand an incredible amount of strength you have witnessed the feats of those strongarmed acrobats who in the sideshow at the fair seize a vertical bar with both hands and without further support sustain themselves in the air the body horizontal inchworms do the same thing but with this difference whereas the acrobats are exhausted in a few moments the caterpillars keep their balance all day if necessary why do they do all those stunts was emiles question they are not doing stunts as you call it they are simply using their natural means of escaping observation on the part of their enemies by reason of their complete immobility rigid posture and grayish hue they are confounded with the small dry twigs which they closely resemble unless examined at very short range they deceive all eyes even those of birds whose sight is so keen ah the crafty rogues to stiffen themselves and stay perfectly still so as to look like little dry twigs and in that way fool the birds that would come and snap them up is a very clever trick the name of leafstripper which is also given to this moth indicates its way of living before it is transformed into the perfect insect the caterpillar gnaws the leaves of all fruittrees without distinction and even of other trees such as oaks birches and lindens for trees that have not been smeared with a tar girdle to stop the moths at laying time there is but one mode of defense left and that is not nearly so good as the first it is to shake the infested trees so as to make the caterpillars fall and then crush them i prefer the tar girdle said louis yes but it must be applied in time in the autumn when the moths are about to make their appearance another moth of this group sometimes called the winter moth has fore wings of a grayish winecolor dotted with brown and striped crosswise in a darker shade the female is a little better favored than that of the one we have just been considering having wings of a sort but too rudimentary to admit of flying it may be seen running over the ground toward the end of autumn when cold weather is approaching its tardy appearance has earned it the name of winter moth like the moth of the inchworm it climbs trees to lay its eggs but can be prevented by the use of tar on the trunk its eggs hatch in the spring and the caterpillars are fullgrown by may they are generally blackish with white yellow or green stripes running lengthwise on leaving the egg these caterpillars bore the buds of pear apple apricot and other fruit trees later they install themselves one by one between two leaves the edges of which they unite with threads of silk chapter liii sapsuckers what do plantlice eat asked jules one day i have never seen them feeding on leaves they do not feed on them his uncle replied they drink the sap through a very fine short pointed sucker which they carry against the breast when not in use the insect plunges it into the plant and for whole days without moving drinks the sap at the point pricked when this place is sucked dry it passes to another but without much change of position the plantlouse is a sedentary creature to move around a stem no bigger than your little finger is for the louse a long journey fraught with perils not lightly to be faced a few steps forward to make room in the rear for some fifty children as fast as they are brought into the world being about all that the boldest of these creatures dares to undertake but plantlice of the last generation of the year have wings and lay eggs which in the spring renew the race annihilated by the cold of winter these winged lice are no timid stayathomes like the others they gladly quit the natal leaf to see a bit of the world it is their business to travel hither and yon and lay their eggs in many places so that in the following spring all plants shall have their share of lice and it is to fulfill this duty that they are expressly provided with wings clouds of these traveling plantlice dense enough to obscure the light of day have been observed many other insects have like the plantlouse a straight pointed sucker which they plunge into the substance they wish to drain of its juice and which they hold against the breast when not in use the cicada furnishes us a very good example as do also the large bugs found on trees and on many plants the cabbage feeds two of them the harlequin cabbagebug which is red with numerous black spots and still another cabbagebug of a bluishgreen color with white or red spots bugs of this class have four wings the upper pair covering the other pair when in repose the forward half of each upper wing is hard like the beetles wing sheaths but the other half is membranous and of fine texture this structure makes them half sheaths for protection and half wings for flying and it is because of this peculiarity that insects of this sort are called hemiptera or halfwinged creatures the cicada is a halfwinged insect as is also the plantlouse although its upper wings i am speaking of winged plantlice of course instead of being one half hard and the other half of a more delicate texture have the same fineness and transparency throughout but the most striking characteristic of these insects and the one that determines their mode of life is the beak for sucking so we will call hemiptera all insects equipped with a pointed sucker which lies against the breast when in repose and we will not concern ourselves with the question of wings whether half or entirely membranous do the hemiptera form an order by themselves asked jules they form an order in the same way that coleoptera lepidoptera hymenoptera diptera and so on form each an order but hemiptera do not undergo so thorough a transformation as other insects being born with very nearly the form they will always have the chief change consists in the growing of wings which the insect does not have at first but acquires later when it has attained sufficient size in some species several generations succeed one another before the winged state which is the perfect one is reached plantlice belong to this class the earlier generations of the year having no wings and only the last being equipped with them a hemipterous insect with habits somewhat like those of the plant louse causes considerable damage to peartrees it is commonly called the flealouse of the pear and is a small reddish insect with diaphanous wings that fold at an angle like the two sides of an acuteangled roof it is found on peartrees and more rarely on appletrees toward the end of april the eggs are laid one by one in slight gashes made in the leafstem by the female with a little auger situated at the end of the abdomen the larvæ that come from these eggs grow rapidly and differ from the perfect insect only in their lack of wings by sloughing the skin these larvæ become nymphs short and stubby and already having on each side a rudimentary wing in its final form the insect acquires perfect wings in all three of its successive stages the insect plunges its sucker into the tender bark or into the leaves and sucks the sap the best way to destroy these creatures is to use a hard bristle brush on those parts of the bark where they are to be found in multitudes chapter liv queer musical instruments uncle paul had placed in the lettuce bed two large pots half full of water and set into the ground flush with the surface he said they were a trap for molecrickets which from the withered appearance of some of the plants he suspected were in the garden one morning on going to look into the pots emile found three drowned molecrickets in them that evening uncle paul told the children about these creatures the insects emile found in the trap said he are called molecrickets from their habit of burrowing into the ground like moles and from their resembling in certain other ways ordinary crickets the molecricket has the common crickets long and slender antennæ its two flexible filaments at the end of the abdomen and its rough wings which are rubbed against each other so as to make a sort of singing noise it is a formidable ravager of our gardens do crickets really chirp with their wings asked emile in surprise yes my boy in chirping the cricket raises its wings which are dry and wrinkled and rubs the edges together vigorously the other chirping insects do about the same the vineyard grasshopper the one with the large green and yellow belly has on its back two round scales which fit together and rub against each other they constitute its musical instrument other grasshoppers play the violin that is to say they scrape the rough edges of their wings with their big curved thighs as bows or fiddlesticks the cicada has under its stomach in a double cavity protected by covers capable of being raised more or less two dry and shiny membranes stretched as taut as drumheads the insect sings by making these vibrate in their cases does the molecricket say creecree like the ordinary cricket no its song has a monotonous sound being a sort of sharp buzzing rather subdued and continuous and why does the molecricket sing what an ugly creature with its little crafty eyes short wings big stomach and frightful fore feet it sings to cheer its solitude and call its mate you think it ugly i find it admirably equipped for the work it has to do it lives in the ground just as moles do and like them it is provided with a special tool for digging in the earth and cutting the roots that bar its way have you ever noticed a moles fore feet they are broadly shovelshaped and furnished with strong claws the molecrickets fore feet are very much like them being short and wide and edged with sawteeth with this pair of powerful tools the insect digs its subterranean tunnels then that said jules must be the reason for calling it a molecricket it has the moles wide feet for digging i should like to know emile interposed what the mole and molecricket do under the ground they hunt for worms and all kinds of insects for food in their subterranean operations both cut with their fore feet the roots that obstruct their progress but the mole exclusively carnivorous does not eat them whereas the molecricket living on both animal and vegetable matter nibbles them at its pleasure nor does it disdain a tender lettuce leaf when at night it comes up above ground to get a little air and cultivate the acquaintance of its neighbors hence the molecricket does a great deal of damage in gardens by laying bare the roots of young plants when it is boring its tunnels or by severing these roots with the sawlike edges of its feet or by nibbling them when hungry not far beneath the surface of the ground the female makes her nest which is in the form of a hollow ball of earth about as large as your fist in this cavity after it has been carefully smoothed and prepared she lays her eggs to the number of three or four hundred after which she remains in the neighborhood as if to watch over them when first hatched the young ones are white all over and look like big ants when the ground is spaded these nests should always be destroyed the molecrickets domain is composed of passages running down to a greater or less distance with hunting galleries just under the surface to dislodge the insect from its retreat a little oil is poured into the hole where it is thought to have taken refuge and then plenty of water from the wateringpot until all the passages are inundated threatened with suffocation by the oil which interferes with its breathing the molecricket soon comes to the surface one can also use the trap that i have found serviceable a wide and deep vessel is set into the ground level with the surface and half filled with water attracted by the coolness the molecrickets fall in and drown in the course of their nocturnal promenades sometimes again at the approach of cold weather holes are dug here and there and filled with horse manure the warmth of the manure is agreeable to the molecrickets and they come and hide in it for the winter when cold weather begins these lurkingplaces are searched and the foolish occupants destroyed the molecricket the housecricket the locust and the grasshopper belong to a family of insects called orthoptera so named from their straight wings that is the lower wings those used for flying are folded lengthwise in a straight line when in repose like a closed fan look at the red or blue wings of the crickets that abound in autumn in dry grass and you will see them neatly folded lengthwise while the upper wings which are somewhat leathery are usually brought together in the shape of a roof many but not all of the orthoptera have thick thighs ending in long and bristly legs that serve for jumping finally some of these insects have at the end of the abdomen a terebra commonly called a sword its office being to lay the eggs in the ground one of these orthoptera commits terrible ravages in africa it is the migratory locust so named because it assembles in immense swarms and migrates to another region when food fails the migrating swarm takes flight as at a given signal and moves through the air like a great cloud even intercepting the light of the sun sooner or later the devastating hordes swoop down like a living storm on the cultivated fields of some province and in a few hours leaves grain pastures fields all are browsed bare as if swept by a conflagration the ground showing not a green blade of any kind surviving if those ravenous locusts travel like that said jules couldnt they come here driven by a favorable wind clouds of locusts do sometimes cross the mediterranean and alight in our southern departments at various times the territory of arles has suffered this terrible visitation it should be added that if the country suits them where they chance to alight the locusts lay their eggs there and from these there springs a legion of devourers more numerous than the first to lessen the ravages of this second generation search is made for the eggs which the locust lays in a cylindrical hole running a few centimeters into the ground in 1832 in the neighborhood of arles nearly four thousand kilograms of eggs were gathered besides bagfuls of the insects themselves it takes eighty thousand eggs to make a kilogram hence in that harvest of eggs there were three hundred and twenty million locusts destroyed before they were born imagine the ravages of such a swarm of devourers alighting on the vegetation of any given district before so terrible a scourge man bows his head and acknowledges his powerlessness the insect ravager overwhelming him by its very numbers how many other ravagers there are my children besides locusts that by their inconceivable multitude defy our attempts to defend ourselves you are now in a position to realize somewhat the serious nature of these devastations when you think of all the moths and caterpillars and worms all the creeping and burrowing and flying insects of all shapes and sizes and appetites that attack our gardens and fields they would certainly gain the upper hand if we had to depend on ourselves in combating them but fortunately we are most ably assisted in this contest '"

              "'the pine processionary the eggs and the hatching this caterpillar has already had his story told by réaumur 1 but it was a story marked by gaps these were inevitable in the conditions under which the great man worked for he had to receive all his materials by barge from the distant bordeaux landes the transplanted insect could not be expected to furnish its biographer with other than fragmentary evidence very weak in those biological details which form the principal charm of entomology to study the habits of insects one must observe them long and closely on their native heath so to speak in the place where their instincts have full and natural play with caterpillars foreign to the paris climate and brought from the other end of france réaumur therefore ran the risk of missing many most interesting facts this is what actually happened just as it did on a later occasion in the case of another alien the cicada 2 nevertheless the information which he was able to extract from a few nests sent to him from the landes is of the highest value better served than he by circumstances i will take up afresh the story of the processionary caterpillar of the pine if the subject does not come up to my hopes it will certainly not be for lack of materials in my harmas 3 laboratory now stocked with a few trees in addition to its bushes stand some vigorous firtrees the aleppo pine and the black austrian pine a substitute for that of the landes every year the caterpillar takes possession of them and spins his great purses in their branches in the interest of the leaves which are horribly ravaged as though there had been a fire i am obliged each winter to make a strict survey and to extirpate the nests with a long forked batten you voracious little creatures if i let you have your way i should soon be robbed of the murmur of my once so leafy pines today i will seek compensation for all the trouble i have taken let us make a compact you have a story to tell tell it me and for a year for two years or longer until i know more or less all about it i shall leave you undisturbed even at the cost of lamentable suffering to the pines having concluded the treaty and left the caterpillars in peace i soon have abundant material for my observations in return for my indulgence i get some thirty nests within a few steps of my door if the collection were not large enough the pinetrees in the neighbourhood would supply me with any necessary additions but i have a preference and a decided preference for the population of my own enclosure whose nocturnal habits are much easier to observe by lanternlight with such treasures daily before my eyes at any time that i wish and under natural conditions i cannot fail to see the processionarys story unfolded at full length let us try and first of all the egg which réaumur did not see in the first fortnight of august let us inspect the lower branches of the pines on a level with our eyes if we pay the least attention we soon discover here and there on the foliage certain little whitish cylinders spotting the dark green these are the bombyx eggs each cylinder is the cluster laid by one mother the pineneedles are grouped in twos each pair is wrapped at its base in a cylindrical muff which measures about an inch long by a fifth or sixth of an inch wide this muff which has a silky appearance and is white slightly tinted with russet is covered with scales that overlap after the manner of the tiles on a roof and yet their arrangement though fairly regular is by no means geometrical the general aspect is more or less that of an immature walnutcatkin the scales are almost oval in form semitransparent and white with a touch of brown at the base and of russet at the tip they are free at the lower end which tapers slightly but firmly fixed at the upper end which is wider and blunter you cannot detach them either by blowing on them or by rubbing them repeatedly with a hairpencil they stand up like a fleece stroked the wrong way if the sheath is rubbed gently upwards and retain this bristling position indefinitely they resume their original arrangement when the friction is in the opposite direction at the same time they are as soft as velvet to the touch carefully laid one upon the other they form a roof that protects the eggs it is impossible for a drop of rain or dew to penetrate under this shelter of soft tiles the origin of this defensive covering is selfevident the mother has stripped a part of her body to protect her eggs like the eiderduck she has made a warm overcoat for them out of her own down réaumur had already suspected as much from a very curious peculiarity of the moth let me quote the passage    the females he says have a shiny patch on the upper part of     their body near the hindquarters the shape and gloss of this     disk attracted my attention the first time that i saw it i was     holding a pin with which i touched it to examine its structure     the contact of the pin produced a little spectacle that surprised     me i saw a cloud of tiny spangles at once detach themselves these     spangles scattered in every direction some seemed to be shot into     the air others to the sides but the greater part of the cloud     fell softly to the ground    each of those bodies which i am calling spangles is an extremely     slender lamina bearing some resemblance to the atoms of dust on     the moths wings but of course much bigger the disk that is so     noticeable on the hindquarters of these moths is therefore a     heapand an enormous heapof these scales the females seem to     use them to wrap their eggs in but the moths of the pine     caterpillar refused to lay while in my charge and consequently did     not enlighten me as to whether they use the scales to cover their     eggs or as to what they are doing with all those scales gathered     round their hinder part which were not given them and placed in     that position to serve no purpose you were right my learned master that dense and regular crop of spangles did not grow on the moths tail for nothing is there anything that has no object you did not think so i do not think so either everything has its reason for existing yes you were wellinspired when you foresaw that the cloud of scales which flew out under the point of your pin must serve to protect the eggs i remove the scaly fleece with my pincers and as i expected the eggs appear looking like little whiteenamel beads clustering closely together they make nine longitudinal rows in one of these rows i count thirtyfive eggs as the nine rows are very nearly alike the contents of the cylinder amount in all to about three hundred eggs a respectable family for one mother the eggs of one row or file alternate exactly with those in the two adjoining files so as to leave no empty spaces they suggest a piece of beadwork produced with exquisite dexterity by patient fingers it would be more correct still to compare them with a cob of indian corn with its neat rows of seeds but a greatly reduced cob the tininess of whose dimensions makes its mathematical precision all the more remarkable the grains of the moths spike have a slight tendency to be hexagonal because of their mutual pressure they are stuck close together so much so that they cannot be separated if force is used the layer comes off the leaf in fragments in small cakes always consisting of several eggs apiece the beads laid are therefore fastened together by a glutinous varnish and it is on this varnish that the broad base of the defensive scales is fixed it would be interesting if a favourable opportunity occurred to see how the mother achieves that beautifully regular arrangement of the eggs and also how as soon as she has laid one all sticky with varnish she makes a roof for it with a few scales removed one by one from her hindquarters for the moment the very structure of the finished work tells us the course of the procedure it is evident that the eggs are not laid in longitudinal files but in circular rows in rings which lie one above the other alternating their grains the laying begins at the bottom near the lower end of the double pineleaf it finishes at the top the first eggs in order of date are those of the bottom ring the last are those of the top ring the arrangement of the scales all in a longitudinal direction and attached by the end facing the top of the leaf makes any other method of progression inadmissible let us consider in the light of reflection the elegant edifice now before our eyes young or old cultured or ignorant we shall all on seeing the bombyx pretty little spike exclaim how handsome and what will strike us most will be not the beautiful enamel pearls but the way in which they are put together with such geometrical regularity whence we can draw a great moral to wit that an exquisite order governs the work of a creature without consciousness one of the humblest of the humble a paltry moth follows the harmonious laws of order if micromégas 4 took it into his head to leave sirius once more and visit our planet would he find anything to admire among us voltaire shows him to us using one of the diamonds of his necklace as a magnifyingglass in order to obtain some sort of view of the threemaster which has run aground on his thumbnail he enters into conversation with the crew a nailparing curved like a horn encompasses the ship and serves as a speakingtrumpet a toothpick which touches the vessel with its tapering end and the lips of the giant some thousand fathoms above with the other serves as a telephone the outcome of the famous dialogue is that if we would form a sound judgment of things and see them under fresh aspects there is nothing like changing ones planet the probability then is that the sirian would have had a rather poor notion of our artistic beauties to him our masterpieces of statuary even though sprung from the chisel of a phidias would be mere dolls of marble or bronze hardly more worthy of interest than the childrens rubber dolls are to us our landscapepaintings would be regarded as dishes of spinach smelling unpleasantly of oil our operascores would be described as very expensive noises these things belonging to the domain of the senses possess a relative æsthetic value subordinated to the organism that judges them certainly the venus of melos and the apollo belvedere are superb works but even so it takes a special eye to appreciate them micromégas if he saw them would be full of pity for the leanness of human forms to him the beautiful calls for something other than our sorry froglike anatomy show him on the other hand that sort of abortive windmill by means of which pythagoras echoing the wise men of egypt teaches us the fundamental properties of the rightangled triangle should the good giant contrary to our expectation happen not to know about it explain to him what the windmill means once the light has entered his mind he will find just as we do that there is beauty there real beauty not certainly in that horrible hieroglyphic the figure but in the unchangeable relation between the lengths of the three sides he will admire as much as we do geometry the eternal balancer of space there is therefore a severe beauty belonging to the domain of reason the same in every world the same under every sun whether the suns be single or many white or red blue or yellow this universal beauty is order everything is done by weight and measure a great statement whose truth breaks upon us all the more vividly as we probe more deeply into the mystery of things is this order upon which the equilibrium of the universe is based the predestined result of a blind mechanism does it enter into the plans of an eternal geometer as plato had it is it the ideal of a supreme lover of beauty which would explain everything why all this regularity in the curve of the petals of a flower why all this elegance in the chasings on a beetles wingcases is that infinite grace even in the tiniest details compatible with the brutality of uncontrolled forces one might as well attribute the artists exquisite medallion to the steamhammer which makes the slag sweat in the melting these are very lofty thoughts concerning a miserable cylinder which will bear a crop of caterpillars it cannot be helped the moment one tries to dig out the least detail of things up starts a why which scientific investigation is unable to answer the riddle of the world has certainly its explanation otherwhere than in the little truths of our laboratories but let us leave micromégas to philosophize and return to the commonplaces of observation the pine bombyx has rivals in the art of gracefully grouping her eggbeads among their number is the neustrian bombyx whose caterpillar is known by the name of livery because of his costume her eggs are assembled in bracelets around little branches varying greatly in nature apple and pearbranches chiefly any one seeing this elegant work for the first time would be ready to attribute it to the fingers of a skilled stringer of beads my small son paul opens eyes wide with surprise and utters an astonished oh each time that he comes upon the dear little bracelet the beauty of order forces itself upon his dawning attention though not so long and marked above all by the absence of any wrapper the ring of the neustrian bombyx reminds one of the others cylinder stripped of its scaly covering it would be easy to multiply these instances of elegant grouping contrived now in one way now in another but always with consummate art it would take up too much time however let us keep to the pine bombyx the hatching takes place in september a little earlier in one case a little later in another so that i may easily watch the newborn caterpillars in their first labours i have placed a few eggladen branches in the window of my study they are standing in a glass of water which will keep them properly fresh for some time the little caterpillars leave the egg in the morning at about eight oclock if i just lift the scales of the cylinder in process of hatching i see black heads appear which nibble and burst and push back the torn ceilings the tiny creatures emerge slowly some here and some there all over the surface after the hatching the scaly cylinder is as regular and as fresh in appearance as if it were still inhabited we do not perceive that it is deserted until we raise the spangles the eggs still arranged in regular rows are now so many yawning goblets of a slightly translucent white they lack the capshaped lid which has been rent and destroyed by the newborn grubs the puny creatures measure a millimetre 5 at most in length devoid as yet of the bright red that will soon be their adornment they are paleyellow bristling with hairs some shortish and black others rather longer and white the head of a glossy black is big in proportion its diameter is twice that of the body this exaggerated size of the head implies a corresponding strength of jaw capable of attacking tough food from the start a huge head stoutly clad in horn is the predominant feature of the budding caterpillar these macrocephalous ones are as we see wellarmed against the hardness of the pineneedles so wellarmed in fact that the meal begins almost immediately after roaming for a few moments at random among the scales of the common cradle most of the young caterpillars make for the double leaf that served as an axis for the native cylinder and spread themselves over it at length others go to the adjacent leaves here as well as there they fall to and the gnawed leaf is hollowed into faint and very narrow grooves bounded by the veins which are left intact from time to time three or four who have eaten their fill fall into line and walk in step but soon separate each going his own way this is practice for the coming processions if i disturb them ever so little they sway the front half of their bodies and wag their heads with a jerky movement similar to the action of an intermittent spring but the sun reaches the corner of the window where the careful rearing is in progress then sufficiently refreshed the little family retreats to its native soil the base of the double leaf gathers into an irregular group and begins to spin its work is a gauze globule of extreme delicacy supported on some of the neighbouring leaves under this tent a very widemeshed net a siesta is taken during the hottest and brightest part of the day in the afternoon when the sun has gone from the window the flock leaves its shelter disperses around sometimes forming a little procession within a radius of an inch and starts browsing again thus the very moment of hatching proclaims talents which age will develop without adding to their number in less than an hour from the bursting of the egg the caterpillar is both a processionary and a spinner he also flees the light when taking refreshment we shall soon find him visiting his grazinggrounds only at night the spinner is very feeble but so active that in twentyfour hours the silken globe attains the bulk of a hazelnut and in a couple of weeks that of an apple nevertheless it is not the nucleus of the great establishment in which the winter is to be spent it is a provisional shelter very light and inexpensive in materials the mildness of the season makes anything else unnecessary the young caterpillars freely gnaw the logs the poles between which the threads are stretched that is to say the leaves contained within the silken tent their house supplies them at the same time with board and lodging this excellent arrangement saves them from having to go out a dangerous proceeding at their age for these puny ones the hammock is also the larder nibbled down to their veins the supporting leaves wither and easily come unfastened from the branches and the silken globe becomes a hovel that crumbles with the first gust of wind the family then moves on and goes elsewhere to erect a new tent lasting no longer than the first even so does the arab move on as the pastures around his camelhide dwelling become exhausted these temporary establishments are renewed several times over always at greater heights than the last so much so that the tribe which was hatched on the lower branches trailing on the ground gradually reaches the higher boughs and sometimes the very summit of the pinetree in a few weeks time a first moult replaces the humble fleece of the start which is palecoloured shaggy and ugly by another which lacks neither richness nor elegance on the dorsal surface the various segments excepting the first three are adorned with a mosaic of six little bare patches of a bright red which stand out a little above the dark background of the skin two the largest are in front two behind and one almost dotshaped on either side of the quadrilateral the whole is surrounded by a palisade of scarlet bristles divergent and lying almost flat the other hairs those of the belly and sides are longer and whitish in the centre of this crimson marquetry stand two clusters of very short bristles gathered into flattened tufts which gleam in the sun like specks of gold the length of the caterpillar is now about two centimetres 6 and his width three or four millimetres 7 such is the costume of middle age which like the earlier one was unknown to réaumur the pine processionary the nest the community november arrives however bringing cold weather the time has come to build the stout winter tabernacle high up in the pine the tip of a bough is chosen with suitably closepacked and convergent leaves the spinners surround it with a spreading network which bends the adjacent leaves a little nearer and ends by incorporating them into the fabric in this way they obtain an enclosure half silk half leaves capable of withstanding the inclemencies of the weather early in december the work has increased to the size of a mans two fists or more in its ultimate perfection it attains a volume of nearly half a gallon by the end of winter it is roughly eggshaped tapering to a certain length below and extended into a sheath which envelops the supporting branch the origin of this silky extension is as follows every evening between seven and nine oclock weather permitting the caterpillars leave the nest and go down the bare part of the bough which forms the pole of the tent the road is broad for this axis is sometimes as wide as the neck of a claretbottle the descent is accomplished without any attempt at order and always slowly so much so that the first caterpillars to come out have not yet dispersed before they are caught up by the others the branch is thus covered by a continuous bark of caterpillars made up of the whole community which gradually divides into squads and disperses to this side and that on the nearest branches to crop their leaves now not one of the caterpillars moves a step without working his spinneret therefore the broad downward path which on the way back will be the ascending path is covered as the result of constant traffic with a multitude of threads forming an unbroken sheath it is obvious that this sheath in which each caterpillar passing backwards and forwards on his nocturnal rambles leaves a double thread is not an indicator laid down with the sole object of simplifying the journey back to the nest a mere ribbon would be enough for that its use might well be to strengthen the edifice to give it deeper foundations and to join it by a multitude of cables to the steady branch the whole thing thus consists above of the home distended into an ovoid and below of the stalk the sheath surrounding the support and adding its resistance to that of the numerous other fastenings each nest that has not yet had its shape altered by the prolonged residence of the caterpillars shows in the centre a bulky milkwhite shell with around it a wrapper of diaphanous gauze the central mass formed of thicklywoven threads has for a wall a thick quilt into which are absorbed as supports numbers of leaves green and intact the thickness of this wall may be anything up to threequarters of an inch at the top of the dome are round openings varying greatly in number and distribution as wide across as an ordinary leadpencil these are the doors of the house through which the caterpillars go in and out all around the shell are projecting leaves which the insects teeth have respected from the tip of each leaf there radiate in graceful undulating curves threads which loosely interlaced form a light tent a spacious verandah of careful workmanship especially in the upper part here we find a broad terrace on which in the daytime the caterpillars come and doze in the sun heaped one upon the other with rounded backs the network stretching overhead does duty as an awning it moderates the heat of the suns rays it also saves the sleepers from a fall when the bough rocks in the wind let us take our scissors and rip open the nest from end to end longitudinally a wide window opens and allows us to see the arrangement of the inside the first thing to strike us is that the leaves contained in the enclosure are intact and quite sound the young caterpillars in their temporary establishments gnaw the leaves within the silken wrapper to death they thus have their larder stocked for a few days without having to quit their shelter in bad weather a condition made necessary by their weakness when they grow stronger and start working on their winter home they are very careful not to touch the leaves why these new scruples the reason is evident if bruised those leaves the framework of the house would very soon wither and then be blown off with the first breath of wind the silken purse torn from its base would collapse on the other hand if the leaves are respected they remain vigorous and furnish a stout support against the assaults of winter a solid fastening is superfluous for the summer tent which lasts but a day it is indispensable to the permanent shelter which will have to bear the burden of heavy snows and the buffeting of icy winds fully alive to these perils the spinner of the pinetree considers himself bound however importunate his hunger not to saw through the rafters of his house inside the nest therefore opened by my scissors i see a thick arcade of green leaves more or less closely wrapped in a silky sheath whence dangle shreds of cast skin and strings of dried droppings in short this interior is an extremely unpleasant place a ragshop and a sewagefarm in one and corresponds in no way with the imposing exterior all around is a solid wall of quilting and of closelywoven leaves there are no chambers no compartments marked off by partitionwalls it is a single room turned into a labyrinth by the colonnade of green leaves placed in rows one above the other throughout the oval hall here the caterpillars stay when resting gathered on the columns heaped in confused masses when we remove the hopeless tangle at the top we see the light filtering in at certain points of the roof these luminous points correspond with the openings that communicate with the outer air the network that forms a wrapper to the nest has no special exits to pass through it in either direction the caterpillars have only to push the sparse threads aside slightly the inner wall a compact rampart has its doors the flimsy outer veil has none it is in the morning at about ten oclock that the caterpillars leave their nightapartment and come to take the sun on their terrace under the awning which the points of the leaves hold up at a distance they spend the whole day there dozing motionless heaped together they steep themselves deliciously in warmth and from time to time betray their bliss by nodding and wagging their heads at six or seven oclock when it grows dark the sleepers awake bestir themselves separate and go their several ways over the surface of the nest we now behold an indeed delightful spectacle brightred stripes meander in every direction over the white sheet of silk one goes up another comes down a third moves aslant others form a short procession and as they solemnly walk about in a splendid disorder each glues to the ground which it covers the thread that constantly hangs from its lip thus is the thickness of the shelter increased by a fine layer added immediately above the previous structure thus is the dwelling strengthened by fresh supports the adjoining green leaves are taken into the network and absorbed in the building if the tiniest bit of them remains free curves radiate from that point increasing the size of the veil and fastening it at a greater distance every evening therefore for an hour or two great animation reigns on the surface of the nest if the weather permits and the work of consolidating and thickening the structure is carried on with indefatigable zeal do they foresee the future these wary ones who take such precautions against the rigours of winter obviously not their few months experienceif indeed experience can be mentioned in connection with a caterpillartells them of savoury bellyfuls of green stuff of gentle slumbers in the sun on the terrace of the nest but nothing hitherto has made them acquainted with cold steady rain with frost snow and furious blasts of wind and these creatures knowing naught of winters woes take the same precautions as if they were thoroughly aware of all that the inclement season holds in store for them they work away at their house with an ardour that seems to say oh how nice and warm we shall be in our beds here nestling one against the other when the pinetree swings aloft its frosted candelabra let us work with a will laboremus yes caterpillars my friends let us work with a will great and small men and grubs alike so that we may fall asleep peacefully you with the torpor that makes way for your transformation into moths we with that last sleep which breaks off life only to renew it laboremus anxious to watch my caterpillars habits in detail without having to sally forth by lanternlight often in bad weather to see what happens in the pinetrees at the end of the enclosure i have installed halfadozen nests in a greenhouse a modest glazed shelter which though hardly any warmer than the air outside at least affords protection from the wind and rain fixed in the sand at a height of about eighteen inches by the base of the bough that serves as both an axis and a framework each nest receives for rations a bundle of little pinebranches which are renewed as soon as they are consumed i take my lantern every evening and pay my boarders a visit this is the way in which most of my facts are obtained after the days work comes the evening meal the caterpillars descend from the nest adding a few more threads to the silvery sheath of the support and reach the posy of fresh green stuff which is lying quite near it is a magnificent sight to see the redcoated band lined up in twos and threes on each needle and in ranks so closely formed that the green sprigs of the bunch bend under the load the diners all motionless all poking their heads forward nibble in silence placidly their broad black foreheads gleam in the rays of the lantern a shower of granules drops on the sand below these are the residues of easygoing stomachs only too ready to digest their food by tomorrow morning the soil will have disappeared under a greenish layer of this intestinal hail yes indeed it is a sight to see one far more stimulating than that of the silkworms messroom young and old we are all so much interested in it that our evenings almost invariably end in a visit to the greenhouse caterpillars the meal is prolonged far into the night satisfied at last some sooner some later they go back to the nest where for a little longer feeling their silkglands filled they continue spinning on the surface these hard workers would scruple to cross the white carpet without contributing a few threads it is getting on for one or even two oclock in the morning when the last of the band goes indoors my duty as a fosterfather is daily to renew the bunch of sprigs which are shorn to the last leaf on the other hand my duty as an historian is to enquire to what extent the diet can be varied the district supplies me with processionaries on the scotch pine the maritime pine and the aleppo pine indifferently but never on the other coniferæ yet one would think that any resinscented leaf ought to suit so says chemical analysis we must mistrust the chemists retort when it pokes its nose into the kitchen it may succeed in making butter out of tallowcandles and brandy out of potatoes but when it tells us that the products are identical we shall do well to refuse these abominations science astonishingly rich as it is in poison will never provide us with anything fit to eat because though the raw substance falls to a large extent within its domain that same substance escapes its methods the moment that it is wanted organized divided and subdivided indefinitely by the process of life as needed by the stomach whose requirements are not to be met by measured doses of our reagents the raw material of cell and fibre may perhaps be artificially obtained some day cell and fibre themselves never theres the rub with your chemical feeding the caterpillars loudly proclaim the insurmountable difficulty of the problem relying on my chemical data i offer them the different substitutes for the pine growing in my enclosure the spruce the yew the thuja the juniper the cypress what am i asking them pine caterpillars to bite into that they will take good care not to despite the tempting resinous smell they would die of hunger rather than touch it one conifer and one only is excepted the cedar my charges browse upon its leaves with no appreciable repugnance why the cedar and not the others i do not know the caterpillars stomach fastidious as our own has its secrets let us pass to other tests i have just slit open longitudinally a nest whose internal structure i want to explore owing to the natural shrinkage of the split swansdown the cleft reaches two fingers breadth in the centre and tapers at the top and bottom what will the spinners do in the presence of such a disaster the operation is performed by day while the caterpillars are slumbering in heaps upon the dome as the livingroom is deserted at this time i can cut boldly with the scissors without risk of damaging any part of the population my ravages do not wake the sleepers all day long not one appears upon the breach this indifference looks as though it were due to the fact that the danger is not yet known things will be different tonight when the busy work begins again however dull they may be the caterpillars will certainly notice that huge window which freely admits the deadly draughts of winter and possessing any amount of padding they will crowd round the dangerous gap and stop it up in a trice thus do we argue forgetting the animals intellectual darkness what really happens is that when night falls the indifference of the caterpillars remains as great as ever the breach in the tent provokes not a sign of excitement they move to and fro on the surface of the nest they work they spin as usual there is no change absolutely none in their behaviour when the road covered chances to bring some of them to the brink of the ravine we see no alacrity on their part no sign of anxiety no attempt to close up the two edges of the slit they simply strive to accomplish the difficult crossing and to continue their stroll as though they were walking on a perfect web and they manage it somehow or other by fixing the thread as far as the length of their body permits having once crossed the gulf they pursue their way imperturbably without stopping any more at the breach others come upon the scene and using the threads already laid as footbridges pass over the rent and walk on leaving their own thread as they go thus the first nights work results in the laying over the cleft of a filmy gauze hardly perceptible but just sufficient for the traffic of the colony the same thing is repeated on the nights that follow and the crevice ends by being closed with a scanty sort of spiders web and that is all there is no improvement by the end of the winter the window made by my scissors is still wide open though thinly veiled its black spindle shape shows from the top of the nest to the bottom there is no darn in the split texture no piece of swansdown let in between the two edges to restore the roof to its original state if the accident had happened in the open air and not under glass the foolish spinners would probably have died of cold in their cracked house twice renewed with the same results this test proves that the pine caterpillars are not alive to the danger of their split dwelling expert spinners though they be they seem as unconscious of the ruin of their work as the spools in a factory are of a broken thread they could easily make good the damage by stopping up the breach with the silk that is lavished elsewhere without urgent need they could weave upon it a material as thick and solid as the rest of the walls but no they placidly continue their habitual task they spin as they spun yesterday and as they will spin tomorrow strengthening the parts that are already strong thickening what is already thick enough and not one thinks of stopping the disastrous gap to let a piece into that hole would mean weaving the tent all over again from the beginning and no insect however industrious goes back to what it has already done i have often called attention to this feature in animal psychology notably i have described the ineptitude of the caterpillar of the great peacock moth 8 when the experimenter lops the top off the complicated eeltrap which forms the pointed end of the cocoon this caterpillar spends the silk remaining to him in work of secondary importance instead of making good the series of cones each fitting into the other which are so essential to the hermits protection he continues his normal task imperturbably as though nothing out of the way had taken place even so does the spinner in the pinetree act with his burst tent your fosterparent must perpetrate yet another piece of mischief o my processionary but this time it shall be to your advantage it does not take me long to perceive that the nests intended to last through the winter often contain a population much greater than that of the temporary shelters woven by the very young caterpillars i also notice that when they have attained their ultimate dimensions these nests differ very considerably in size the largest of them are equal to five or six of the smallest what is the cause of these variations certainly if all the eggs turned out well the scaly cylinder containing the laying of a single mother would be enough to fill a splendid purse there are three hundred enamelled beads here for hatching but in families which swarm unduly an enormous waste always takes places and restores the balance of things if the called are legion the chosen are a well thinnedout troop as is proved by the cicada the praying mantis 9 and the cricket the pine processionary another crucible of organic matter of which various devourers take advantage is also reduced in numbers immediately after the hatching the delicate mouthful has shrunk to a few dozens of survivors around the light globular network in which the family passes the sunny autumn days soon they will have to be thinking of the stoutlybuilt winter tent at such a time it would be a boon if they could be many for from union springs strength i suspect an easy method of fusion among a few families to serve them as a guide in their peregrinations about the tree the caterpillars have their silk ribbon which they follow on their return after describing a bend they may also miss it and strike another one differing in no respect from their own this new ribbon marks the way to some nest situated in the neighbourhood the strayed caterpillars failing to distinguish it from their own ribbon follow it conscientiously and in this manner end by reaching a strange dwelling suppose them to be peacefully received what will happen once fused the several groups assembled by the accident of the path will form a powerful city fitted to produce great works the concerted weaklings will give rise to a strong united body this would explain the thicklypopulated bulky nests situated so near to others that have remained puny the former would be the work of a syndicate incorporating the interests of spinners collected from different parts the latter would belong to families left in isolation by the luck of the road it remains to be seen whether the chancecomers guided by a strange ribbon meet with a good reception in the new abode the experiment is easily made upon the nests in the greenhouse in the evening at the hours devoted to grazing i remove with a pruningshears the different little branches covered with the population of one nest and lay them on the provisions of the neighbouring nest which provisions are also overrun with caterpillars or i can make shorter work of it by taking the whole bunch well covered with the troop of the first pouch and planting it right beside the bunch of the second so that the leaves of the two mingle a little at the edges there is not the least quarrelling between the real proprietors and the new arrivals both go on peacefully browsing as though nothing had happened and all without hesitation when bedtime comes make for the nest like brothers who have always lived together all do some spinning before retiring to rest thicken the blanket a little and are then swallowed up in the dormitory by repeating the same operation next day and if necessary the day after in order to collect the laggards i succeed without the slightest difficulty in wholly depopulating the first nest and transferring all its caterpillars to the second i venture to do something better still the same method of transportation allows me to quadruple the output of a spinningmill by adding to it the workers of three similar establishments and if i limit myself to this increase the reason is not that any confusion manifests itself in this shifting of quarters but that i see no bounds to my experiment so cheerfully do the caterpillars accept any addition to their number the more spinners the more spinning a very judicious rule of conduct let us add that the caterpillars which have been transported cherish no regrets for their old house they are quite at home with the others and make no attempt to regain the nest whence they were banished by my artifices it is not the distance that discourages them for the empty dwelling is only half a yard away at most if for the purpose of my studies i wish to restock the deserted nest i am obliged once more to resort to transportation which invariably proves successful later in february when an occasional fine day allows of long processions on the walls and the sandcovered shelf of the greenhouse i am able to watch the fusing of two groups without personally intervening all that i have to do is patiently to follow the evolutions of a file on the march i see it sometimes after leaving one nest enter a different one guided by some fortuitous change of route thenceforward the strangers form part of the community on the same footing as the others in a like fashion when the caterpillars walk abroad upon the tree at night the scanty groups of the outset must increase and gather the number of spinners which an extensive building requires everything for everybody so says the pine processionary nibbling his leaves without quarrelling in the least over his neighbours mouthfuls or else enteringand being always peacefully receivedanothers home precisely as he would his own whether a member of the tribe or a stranger he finds room in the refectory and room in the dormitory the others nest is his nest the others grazingground is his grazingground in which he is entitled to his fair share one neither greater nor smaller than the share of his habitual or casual companions each for all and all for each so says the processionary who every evening spends his little capital of silk on enlarging a shelter that is often new to him what would he do with his puny skein if alone hardly anything but there are hundreds and hundreds of them in the spinningmill and the result of their infinitesimal contributions woven into a common stuff is a thick blanket capable of resisting the winter in working for himself each works for the others and these on their side work as zealously for each o lucky animals that know nothing of property the mother of strife o enviable cenobites who practise the strictest communism these habits of the caterpillars invite a few reflections generous minds richer in illusions than in logic set communism before us as the sovran cure for human ills is it practicable among mankind at all times there have been there still are and there always will be fortunately associations in which it is possible to forget in common some small part of the hardships of life but is it possible to generalize the caterpillars of the pine can give us much valuable information in this respect let us have no false shame our material needs are shared by the animals they struggle as we do to take part in the general banquet of the living and the manner in which they solve the problem of existence is not to be despised let us then ask ourselves what are the reasons that cause cenobitism to flourish among the processionaries one answer suggests itself inevitably to begin with the food problem that terrible disturber of the worlds tranquillity is here nonexistent peace reigns as soon as the stomach is certain of being filled without a struggle a pineneedle or even less suffices for the caterpillars meal and that needle is always there waiting to be eaten is there in inexhaustible numbers almost on the threshold of the home when dinnertime arrives we caterpillars go out we take the air we walk a little in procession then without laborious seeking without jealous rivalries we seat ourselves at the banquet the table is plentifully spread and will never be bare so large and generous is the pine all that we need do is from one evening to the next to move our diningroom a little farther on consequently there are no present and no future cares on the subject of provisions the caterpillar finds food to eat almost as easily as he finds air to breathe the atmosphere feeds all creatures on air with a bounty which it is not necessary to crave all unknown to itself without the agency of any effort or labour the animal receives its share of the most vital of elements the niggardly earth on the contrary surrenders its gifts only when laboriously forced not fruitful enough to satisfy every need it leaves the division of the food to the fierce eagerness of competition the mouthful to be procured engenders war between consumers look at two groundbeetles coming at the same time upon a bit of earthworm which of the two shall have the morsel the matter shall be decided by battle desperate ferocious battle with these famished ones who eat at long intervals and do not always eat their fill communal life is out of the question the pine caterpillar is free from these woes he finds the earth as generous as the atmosphere he finds eating as easy as breathing other instances of perfect communism might be named all occur among species living on a vegetable diet provided however that victuals are plentiful and obtainable without a hard search an animal diet on the contrary a prey always more or less difficult to secure banishes cenobitism where the portion is too small for one what excuse would there be for guests the pine processionary knows nothing of privation he knows as little of family ties another source of unrelenting competition to make ourselves a place in the sun is but a half of the struggle imposed upon us by life we must also as far as possible prepare a place for our successors and as the preservation of the species is of greater importance than that of the individual the struggle for the future is even fiercer than the struggle for the present every mother regards the welfare of her offspring as her primary law perish all else provided that the brood flourish every one for himself is her maxim imposed by the rigours of the general conflict every one for himself is her rule the safeguard of the future with maternity and its imperious duties communism ceases to be practicable at first sight certain hymenoptera 10 seem to declare the contrary we find for instance the masonbees of the sheds 11 nesting in myriads on the same tiles and building a monumental edifice at which all the mothers work is this really a community not at all it is a city in which the inhabitants have neighbours not collaborators each mother kneads her pots of honey each amasses a dowry for her offspring and nothing but a dowry for her offspring each wears herself out for her family and only for her family oh it would be a serious business if some one merely came and alighted on the brim of a cell that did not belong to her the mistress of the house would give her to understand by means of a sound drubbing that manners such as those are not to be endured she would have to skedaddle very quickly unless she wanted a fight the rights of property are sacred here even the much more social hivebee is no exception to the rule of maternal egoism to each hive one mother if there be two civil war breaks out and one of them perishes by the others dagger or else quits the country followed by a part of the swarm although virtually fit to lay eggs the other bees to the number of some twenty thousand renounce maternity and vow themselves to celibacy in order to bring up the prodigious family of the one and only mother here communism reigns under certain aspects but for the immense majority motherhood is forthwith abolished even so with the wasps the ants the termites 12 and the various social insects life in common costs them dear thousands and thousands remain incomplete and become the humble auxiliaries of a few who are sexually endowed but whenever maternity is the general portion individualism reappears as among the masonbees notwithstanding their show of communism the pine caterpillars are exempt from the duty of preserving the race they have no sex or rather are obscurely preparing one as undecided and rudimentary as all that is not yet but must one day be with the blossoming of maternity that flower of adult age individual property will not fail to appear attended by its rivalries the insect now so peaceable will like the others have its displays of selfish intolerance the mothers will isolate themselves jealous of the double pineneedle in which the cylinder of eggs is to be fixed the males fluttering their wings will challenge one another for the possession of the coveted bride it is not a serious struggle among these easygoing ones but still it presents a faint picture of those mortal affrays which the mating so often produces love rules the world by battle it too is a hotbed of competition the caterpillar being almost sexless is indifferent to amorous instincts this is the first condition for living pacifically in common but it is not enough the perfect concord of the community demands among all its members an equal division of strength and talent of taste and capacity for work this condition which perhaps is the most important of all is fulfilled preeminently if there were hundreds if there were thousands of them in the same nest there would be no difference between any of them they are all the same size and equally strong all wear the same dress all possess the same gift for spinning and all with equal zeal expend the contents of their silkglands for the general welfare no one idles no one lounges along when there is work to be done with no other stimulus than the satisfaction of doing their duty every evening when the weather is favourable they all spin with equal industry and drain to the last drop their reservoirs of silk which have become distended during the day in their tribe there is no question of skilled or unskilled of strong or weak of abstemious or gluttonous there are neither hardworkers nor idlers neither savers nor spendthrifts what one does the others do with a like zeal no more and no less well it is a splendid world of equality truly but alas a world of caterpillars if it suited us to go to school to the pine processionary we should soon see the inanity of our levelling and communistic theories equality is a magnificent political catchword but little more where is it this equality of ours in our social groups could we find as many as two persons exactly equal in strength health intelligence capacity for work foresight and all the other gifts which are the great factors of prosperity where should we find anything analogous to the exact parity prevailing among caterpillars nowhere inequality is our law and a good thing too a sound which is invariably the same however often multiplied does not constitute a harmony we need dissimilarities sounds loud and soft deep and shrill we need even discords which by their harshness throw into relief the sweetness of the chords in the same way human societies are harmonious only with the aid of contraries if the dreams of our levellers could be realized we should sink to the monotony of the caterpillar societies art science progress and the lofty flights of the imagination would slumber indefinitely in the dead calm of mediocrity besides if this general levelling were effected we should still be very far from communism to achieve that we should have to do away with the family as the caterpillars and plato teach us we should need abundance of food obtained without any effort so long as a mouthful of bread is difficult to acquire demanding an industry and labour of which we are not all equally capable so long as the family remains the sacred reason for our foresight so long will the generous theory of all for each and each for all be absolutely impracticable and then should we gain by abolishing the struggle for the daily bread of ourselves and those dependent on us it is very doubtful we should be getting rid of this worlds two great joys work and the family the only joys that give any value to life we should be stifling exactly that which makes our greatness and the result of this bestial sacrilege would be a community of human caterpillars thus does the pine processionary teach us by his example the pine processionary the procession drover dingdongs sheep followed the ram which panurge had maliciously thrown overboard and leapt nimbly into the sea one after the other for you know says rabelais it is the nature of the sheep always to follow the first wheresoever it goes which makes aristotle mark them for the most silly and foolish animals in the world 13 the pine caterpillar is even more sheeplike not from foolishness but from necessity where the first goes all the others go in a regular string with not an empty space between them they proceed in single file in a continuous row each touching with its head the rear of the one in front of it the complex twists and turns described in his vagaries by the caterpillar leading the van are scrupulously described by all the others no greek theoria winding its way to the eleusinian festivals was ever more orderly hence the name of processionary given to the gnawer of the pine his character is complete when we add that he is a ropedancer all his life long he walks only on the tightrope a silken rail placed in position as he advances the caterpillar who chances to be at the head of the procession dribbles his thread without ceasing and fixes it on the path which his fickle preferences cause him to take the thread is so tiny that the eye though armed with a magnifyingglass suspects it rather than sees it but a second caterpillar steps on the slender footboard and doubles it with his thread a third trebles it and all the others however many there be add the sticky spray from their spinnerets so much so that when the procession has marched by there remains as a record of its passing a narrow white ribbon whose dazzling whiteness shimmers in the sun very much more sumptuous than ours their system of roadmaking consists in upholstering with silk instead of macadamizing we sprinkle our roads with broken stones and level them by the pressure of a heavy steamroller they lay over their paths a soft satin rail a work of general interest to which each contributes his thread what is the use of all this luxury could they not like other caterpillars walk about without these costly preparations i see two reasons for their mode of progression it is night when the processionaries sally forth to browse upon the pineleaves they leave their nest situated at the top of a bough in profound darkness they go down the denuded pole till they come to the nearest branch that has not yet been gnawed a branch which becomes lower and lower by degrees as the consumers finish stripping the upper storeys they climb up this untouched branch and spread over the green needles when they have had their suppers and begin to feel the keen night air the next thing is to return to the shelter of the house measured in a straight line the distance is not great hardly an arms length but it cannot be covered in this way on foot the caterpillars have to climb down from one crossing to the next from the needle to the twig from the twig to the branch from the branch to the bough and from the bough by a no less angular path to go back home it is useless to rely upon sight as a guide on this long and erratic journey the processionary it is true has five ocular specks on either side of his head but they are so infinitesimal so difficult to make out through the magnifyingglass that we cannot attribute to them any great power of vision besides what good would those shortsighted lenses be in the absence of light in black darkness it is equally useless to think of the sense of smell has the processional any olfactory powers or has he not i do not know without giving a positive answer to the question i can at least declare that his sense of smell is exceedingly dull and in no way suited to help him find his way this is proved in my experiments by a number of hungry caterpillars that after a long fast pass close beside a pinebranch without betraying any eagerness or showing a sign of stopping it is the sense of touch that tells them where they are so long as their lips do not chance to light upon the pastureland not one of them settles there though he be ravenous they do not hasten to food which they have scented from afar they stop at a branch which they encounter on their way apart from sight and smell what remains to guide them in returning to the nest the ribbon spun on the road in the cretan labyrinth theseus would have been lost but for the clue of thread with which ariadne supplied him the spreading maze of the pineneedles is especially at night as inextricable a labyrinth as that constructed for minos the processionary finds his way through it without the possibility of a mistake by the aid of his bit of silk at the time for going home each easily recovers either his own thread or one or other of the neighbouring threads spread fanwise by the diverging herd one by one the scattered tribe line up on the common ribbon which started from the nest and the sated caravan finds its way back to the manor with absolute certainty longer expeditions are made in the daytime even in winter if the weather be fine our caterpillars then come down from the tree venture on the ground march in procession for a distance of thirty yards or so the object of these sallies is not to look for food for the native pinetree is far from being exhausted the shorn branches hardly count amid the vast leafage moreover the caterpillars observe complete abstinence till nightfall the trippers have no other object than a constitutional a pilgrimage to the outskirts to see what these are like possibly an inspection of the locality where later on they mean to bury themselves in the sand for their metamorphosis it goes without saying that in these greater evolutions the guiding cord is not neglected it is now more necessary than ever all contribute to it from the produce of their spinnerets as is the invariable rule whenever there is a progression not one takes a step forward without fixing to the path the thread hanging from his lip if the series forming the procession be at all long the ribbon is dilated sufficiently to make it easy to find nevertheless on the homeward journey it is not picked up without some hesitation for observe that the caterpillars when on the march never turn completely to wheel round on their tightrope is a method utterly unknown to them in order therefore to regain the road already covered they have to describe a zigzag whose windings and extent are determined by the leaders fancy hence come gropings and roamings which are sometimes prolonged to the point of causing the herd to spend the night out of doors it is not a serious matter they collect into a motionless cluster tomorrow the search will start afresh and will sooner or later be successful oftener still the winding curve meets the guidethread at the first attempt as soon as the first caterpillar has the rail between his legs all hesitation ceases and the band makes for the nest with hurried steps the use of this silktapestried roadway is evident from a second point of view to protect himself against the severity of the winter which he has to face when working the pine caterpillar weaves himself a shelter in which he spends his bad hours his days of enforced idleness alone with none but the meagre resources of his silkglands he would find difficulty in protecting himself on the top of a branch buffeted by the winds a substantial dwelling proof against snow gales and icy fogs requires the cooperation of a large number out of the individuals piledup atoms the community obtains a spacious and durable establishment the enterprise takes a long time to complete every evening when the weather permits the building has to be strengthened and enlarged it is indispensable therefore that the corporation of workers should not be dissolved while the stormy season continues and the insects are still in the caterpillar stage but without special arrangements each nocturnal expedition at grazingtime would be a cause of separation at that moment of appetite for food there is a return to individualism the caterpillars become more or less scattered settling singly on the branches around each browses his pineneedle separately how are they to find one another afterwards and become a community again the several threads left on the road make this easy with that guide every caterpillar however far he may be comes back to his companions without ever missing the way they come hurrying from a host of twigs from here from there from above from below and soon the scattered legion reforms into a group the silk thread is something more than a roadmaking expedient it is the social bond the system that keeps the members of the community indissolubly united at the head of every procession long or short goes a first caterpillar whom i will call the leader of the march or file though the word leader which i use for want of a better is a little out of place here nothing in fact distinguishes this caterpillar from the others it just depends upon the order in which they happen to line up and mere chance brings him to the front among the processionaries every captain is an officer of fortune the actual leader leads presently he will be a subaltern if the file should break up in consequence of some accident and be formed anew in a different order his temporary functions give him an attitude of his own while the others follow passively in a close file he the captain tosses himself about and with an abrupt movement flings the front of his body hither and thither as he marches ahead he seems to be seeking his way does he in point of fact explore the country does he choose the most practicable places or are his hesitations merely the result of the absence of a guiding thread on ground that has not yet been covered his subordinates follow very placidly reassured by the cord which they hold between their legs he deprived of that support is uneasy why cannot i read what passes under his black shiny skull so like a drop of tar to judge by actions there is here a small dose of discernment which is able after experimenting to recognize excessive roughnesses overslippery surfaces dusty places that offer no resistance and above all the threads left by other excursionists this is all or nearly all that my long acquaintance with the processionaries has taught me as to their mentality poor brains indeed poor creatures whose commonwealth has its safety hanging upon a thread the processions vary greatly in length the finest that i have seen manœuvring on the ground measured twelve or thirteen yards and numbered about three hundred caterpillars drawn up with absolute precision in a wavy line but if there were only two in a row the order would still be perfect the second touches and follows the first by february i have processions of all lengths in the greenhouse what tricks can i play upon them i see only two to do away with the leader and to cut the thread the suppression of the leader of the file produces nothing striking if the thing is done without creating a disturbance the procession does not alter its ways at all the second caterpillar promoted to captain knows the duties of his rank offhand he selects and leads or rather he hesitates and gropes the breaking of the silk ribbon is not very important either i remove a caterpillar from the middle of the file with my scissors so as not to cause a commotion in the ranks i cut the piece of ribbon on which he stood and clear away every thread of it as a result of this breach the procession acquires two marching leaders each independent of the other it may be that the one in the rear joins the file ahead of him from which he is separated by but a slender interval in that case things return to their original condition more frequently the two parts do not become reunited in that case we have two distinct processions each of which wanders where it pleases and diverges from the other nevertheless both will be able to return to the nest by discovering sooner or later in the course of their peregrinations the ribbon on the other side of the break these two experiments are only moderately interesting i have thought out another one more fertile in possibilities i propose to make the caterpillars describe a close circuit after the ribbons running from it and liable to bring about a change of direction have been destroyed the locomotive engine pursues its invariable course so long as it is not shunted on to a branchline if the processionaries find the silken rail always clear in front of them with no switches anywhere will they continue on the same track will they persist in following a road that never comes to an end what we have to do is to produce this circuit which is unknown under ordinary conditions by artificial means the first idea that suggests itself is to seize with the forceps the silk ribbon at the back of the train to bend it without shaking it and to bring the end of it ahead of the file if the caterpillar marching in the van steps upon it the thing is done the others will follow him faithfully the operation is very simple in theory but very difficult in practice and produces no useful results the ribbon which is extremely slight breaks under the weight of the grains of sand that stick to it and are lifted with it if it does not break the caterpillars at the back however delicately we may go to work feel a disturbance which makes them curl up or even let go there is a yet greater difficulty the leader refuses the ribbon laid before him the cut end makes him distrustful failing to see the regular uninterrupted road he slants off to the right or left he escapes at a tangent if i try to interfere and to bring him back to the path of my choosing he persists in his refusal shrivels up does not budge and soon the whole procession is in confusion we will not insist the method is a poor one very wasteful of effort for at best a problematical success we ought to interfere as little as possible and obtain a natural closed circuit can it be done yes it lies in our power without the least meddling to see a procession march along a perfect circular track i owe this result which is eminently deserving of our attention to pure chance on the shelf with the layer of sand in which the nests are planted stand some big palmvases measuring nearly a yard and a half in circumference at the top the caterpillars often scale the sides and climb up to the moulding which forms a cornice around the opening this place suits them for their processions perhaps because of the absolute firmness of the surface where there is no fear of landslides as on the loose sandy soil below and also perhaps because of the horizontal position which is favorable to repose after the fatigue of the ascent it provides me with a circular track all readymade i have nothing to do but wait for an occasion propitious to my plans this occasion is not long in coming on the 30th of january 1896 a little before twelve oclock in the day i discover a numerous troop making their way up and gradually reaching the popular cornice slowly in single file the caterpillars climb the great vase mount the ledge and advance in regular procession while others are constantly arriving and continuing the series i wait for the string to close up that is to say for the leader who keeps following the circular moulding to return to the point from which he started my object is achieved in a quarter of an hour the closed circuit is realized magnificently in something very nearly approaching a circle the next thing is to get rid of the rest of the ascending column which would disturb the fine order of the procession by an excess of newcomers it is also important that we should do away with all the silken paths both new and old that can put the cornice into communication with the ground with a thick hairpencil i sweep away the surplus climbers with a big brush one that leaves no smell behind itfor this might afterwards prove confusingi carefully rub down the vase and get rid of every thread which the caterpillars have laid on the march when these preparations are finished a curious sight awaits us in the uninterrupted circular procession there is no longer a leader each caterpillar is preceded by another on whose heels he follows guided by the silk track the work of the whole party he again has a companion close behind him following him in the same orderly way and this is repeated without variation throughout the length of the chain none commands or rather none modifies the trail according to his fancy all obey trusting in the guide who ought normally to lead the march and who in reality has been abolished by my trickery from the first circuit of the edge of the tub the rail of silk has been laid in position and is soon turned into a narrow ribbon by the procession which never ceases dribbling its thread as it goes the rail is simply doubled and has no branches anywhere for my brush has destroyed them all what will the caterpillars do on this deceptive closed path will they walk endlessly round and round until their strength gives out entirely the old schoolmen were fond of quoting buridans 14 ass that famous donkey who when placed between two bundles of hay starved to death because he was unable to decide in favour of either by breaking the equilibrium between two equal but opposite attractions they slandered the worthy animal the ass who is no more foolish than any one else would reply to the logical snare by feasting off both bundles will my caterpillars show a little of his mother wit will they after many attempts be able to break the equilibrium of their closed circuit which keeps them on a road without a turning will they make up their minds to swerve to this side or that which is the only method of reaching their bundle of hay the green branch yonder quite near not two feet off i thought that they would and i was wrong i said to myself the procession will go on turning for some time for an hour two hours perhaps then the caterpillars will perceive their mistake they will abandon the deceptive road and make their descent somewhere or other that they should remain up there hard pressed by hunger and the lack of cover when nothing prevented them from going away seemed to me inconceivable imbecility facts however forced me to accept the incredible let us describe them in detail the circular procession begins as i have said on the 30th of january about midday in splendid weather the caterpillars march at an even pace each touching the stern of the one in front of him the unbroken chain eliminates the leader with his changes of direction and all follow mechanically as faithful to their circle as are the hands of a watch the headless file has no liberty left no will it has become mere clockwork and this continues for hours and hours my success goes far beyond my wildest suspicions i stand amazed at it or rather i am stupefied meanwhile the multiplied circuits change the original rail into a superb ribbon a twelfth of an inch broad i can easily see it glittering on the red ground of the pot the day is drawing to a close and no alteration has yet taken place in the position of the trail a striking proof confirms this the trajectory is not a plane curve but one which at a certain point deviates and goes down a little way to the lower surface of the cornice returning to the top some eight inches farther i marked these two points of deviation in pencil on the vase at the outset well all that afternoon and more conclusive still on the following days right to the end of this mad dance i see the string of caterpillars dip under the ledge at the first point and come to the top again at the second once the first thread is laid the road to be pursued is permanently established if the road does not vary the speed does i measure nine centimetres 15 a minute as the average distance covered but there are more or less lengthy halts the pace slackens at times especially when the temperature falls at ten oclock in the evening the walk is little more than a lazy swaying of the body i foresee an early halt in consequence of the cold of fatigue and doubtless also of hunger grazingtime has arrived the caterpillars have come crowding from all the nests in the greenhouse to browse upon the pinebranches planted by myself beside the silken purses those in the garden do the same for the temperature is mild the others lined up along the earthenware cornice would gladly take part in the feast they are bound to have an appetite after a ten hours walk the branch stands green and tempting not a hands breadth away to reach it they need but go down and the poor wretches foolish slaves of their ribbon that they are cannot make up their minds to do so i leave the famished ones at halfpast ten persuaded that they will take counsel with their pillow and that on the morrow things will have resumed their ordinary course i was wrong i was expecting too much of them when i accorded them that faint gleam of intelligence which the tribulations of a distressful stomach ought one would think to have aroused i visit them at dawn they are lined up as on the day before but motionless when the air grows a little warmer they shake off their torpor revive and start walking again the circular procession begins anew like that which i have already seen there is nothing more and nothing less to be noted in their machinelike obstinacy this time it is a bitter night a cold snap has supervened was indeed foretold in the evening by the garden caterpillars who refused to come out despite appearances which to my duller senses seemed to promise a continuation of the fine weather at daybreak the rosemarywalks are all asparkle with rime and for the second time this year there is a sharp frost the large pond in the garden is frozen over what can the caterpillars in the conservatory be doing let us go and see all are ensconced in their nests except the stubborn processionists on the edge of the vase who deprived of shelter as they are seem to have spent a very bad night i find them clustered in two heaps without any attempt at order they have suffered less from the cold thus huddled together tis an ill wind that blows nobody any good the severity of the night has caused the ring to break into two segments which will perhaps afford a chance of safety each group as it revives and resumes its walk will presently be headed by a leader who not being obliged to follow a caterpillar in front of him will possess some liberty of movement and perhaps be able to make the procession swerve to one side remember that in the ordinary processions the caterpillar walking ahead acts as a scout while the others if nothing occurs to create excitement keep to their ranks he attends to his duties as a leader and is continually turning his head to this side and that investigating seeking groping making his choice and things happen as he decides the band follows him faithfully remember also that even on a road which has already been travelled and beribboned the guiding caterpillar continues to explore there is reason to believe that the processionaries who have lost their way on the ledge will find a chance of safety here let us watch them on recovering from their torpor the two groups line up by degrees into two distinct files there are therefore two leaders free to go where they please independent of each other will they succeed in leaving the enchanted circle at the sight of their large black heads swaying anxiously from side to side i am inclined to think so for a moment but i am soon undeceived as the ranks fill out the two sections of the chain meet and the circle is reconstituted the momentary leaders once more become simple subordinates and again the caterpillars march round and round all day for the second time in succession the night which is very calm and magnificently starry brings a hard frost in the morning the processionaries on the tub the only ones who have camped out unsheltered are gathered into a heap which largely overflows both sides of the fatal ribbon i am present at the awakening of the numbed ones the first to take the road is as luck will have it outside the track hesitatingly he ventures into unknown ground he reaches the top of the rim and descends upon the other side on the earth in the vase he is followed by six others no more perhaps the rest of the troop who have not fully recovered from their nocturnal torpor are to lazy to bestir themselves the result of this brief delay is a return to the old track the caterpillars embark on the silken trail and the circular march is resumed this time in the form of a ring with a gap in it there is no attempt however to strike a new course on the part of the guide whom this gap has placed at the head a chance of stepping outside the magic circle has presented itself at last and he does not know how to avail himself of it as for the caterpillars who have made their way to the inside of the vase their lot is hardly improved they climb to the top of the palm starving and seeking for food finding nothing to eat that suits them they retrace their steps by following the thread which they have left on the way climb the ledge of the pot strike the procession again and without further anxiety slip back into the ranks once more the ring is complete once more the circle turns and turns then when will the deliverance come there is a legend that tells of poor souls dragged along in an endless round until the hellish charm is broken by a drop of holy water what drop will good fortune sprinkle on my processionaries to dissolve their circle and bring them back to the nest i see only two means of conjuring the spell and obtaining a release from the circuit these two means are two painful ordeals a strange linking of cause and effect from sorrow and wretchedness good is to come and first shrivelling as the result of cold the caterpillars gather together without any order heap themselves some on the path some more numerous these outside it among the latter there may be sooner or later some revolutionary who scorning the beaten track will trace out a new road and lead the troop back home we have just seen an instance of it seven penetrated to the interior of the vase and climbed the palm true it was an attempt with no result but still an attempt for complete success all that need be done would have been to take the opposite slope an even chance is a great thing another time we shall be more successful in the second place the exhaustion due to fatigue and hunger a lame one stops unable to go farther in front of the defaulter the procession still continues to wend its way for a short time the ranks close up and an empty space appears on coming to himself and resuming the march the caterpillar who has caused the breach becomes a leader having nothing before him the least desire for emancipation is all that he wants to make him launch the band into a new path which perhaps will be the saving path in short when the processionaries train is in difficulties what it needs unlike ours is to run off the rails the sidetracking is left to the caprice of a leader who alone is capable of turning to the right or left and this leader is absolutely nonexistent so long as the ring remains unbroken lastly the breaking of the circle the one stroke of luck is the result of a chaotic halt caused principally by excess of fatigue or cold the liberating accident especially that of fatigue occurs fairly often in the course of the same day the moving circumference is cut up several times into two or three sections but continuity soon returns and no change takes place things go on just the same the bold innovator who is to save the situation has not yet had his inspiration there is nothing new on the fourth day after an icy night like the previous one nothing to tell except the following detail yesterday i did not remove the trace left by the few caterpillars who made their way to the inside of the vase this trace together with a junction connecting it with the circular road is discovered in the course of the morning half the troop takes advantage of it to visit the earth in the pot and climb the palm the other half remains on the ledge and continues to walk along the old rail in the afternoon the band of emigrants rejoins the others the circuit is completed and things return to their original condition we come to the fifth day the night frost becomes more intense without however as yet reaching the greenhouse it is followed by bright sunshine in a calm and limpid sky as soon as the suns rays have warmed the panes a little the caterpillars lying in heaps wake up and resume their evolutions on the ledge of the vase this time the fine order of the beginning is disturbed and a certain disorder becomes manifest apparently an omen of deliverance near at hand the scoutingpath inside the vase which was upholstered in silk yesterday and the day before is today followed to its origin on the rim by a part of the band and is then abandoned after a short loop the other caterpillars follow the usual ribbon the result of this bifurcation is two almost equal files walking along the ledge in the same direction at a short distance from each other sometimes meeting separating farther on in every case with some lack of order weariness increases the confusion the crippled who refuse to go on are many breaches increase files are split up into sections each of which has its leader who pokes the front of his body this way and that to explore the ground everything seems to point to the disintegration which will bring safety my hopes are once more disappointed before the night the single file is reconstituted and the invincible gyration resumed heat comes just as suddenly as the cold did today the 4th of february is a beautiful mild day the greenhouse is full of life numerous festoons of caterpillars issuing from the nests meander along the sand on the shelf above them at every moment the ring on the ledge of the vase breaks up and comes together again for the first time i see daring leaders who drunk with heat standing only on their hinder prolegs at the extreme edge of the earthenware rim fling themselves forward into space twisting about sounding the depths the endeavour is frequently repeated while the whole troop stops the caterpillars heads give sudden jerks their bodies wriggle one of the pioneers decides to take the plunge he slips under the ledge four follow him the others still confiding in the perfidious silken path dare not copy him and continue to go along the old road the short string detached from the general chain gropes about a great deal hesitates long on the side of the vase it goes halfway down then climbs up again slantwise rejoins and takes its place in the procession this time the attempt has failed though at the foot of the vase not nine inches away there lay a bunch of pineneedles which i had placed there with the object of enticing the hungry ones smell and sight told them nothing near as they were to the goal they went up again no matter the endeavour has its uses threads were laid on the way and will serve as a lure to further enterprise the road of deliverance has its first landmarks and two days later on the eighth day of the experiment the caterpillarsnow singly anon in small groups then again in strings of some lengthcome down from the ledge by following the stakedout path at sunset the last of the laggards is back in the nest now for a little arithmetic for seven times twentyfour hours the caterpillars have remained on the ledge of the vase to make an ample allowance for stops due to the weariness of this one or that and above all for the rest taken during the colder hours of the night we will deduct onehalf of the time this leaves eightyfour hours walking the average pace is nine centimetres 16 a minute the aggregate distance covered therefore is 453 metres a good deal more than a quarter of a mile which is a great walk for these little crawlers the circumference of the vase the perimeter of the track is exactly 1 m 35 17 therefore the circle covered always in the same direction and always without result was described three hundred and thirtyfive times these figures surprise me though i am already familiar with the abysmal stupidity of insects as a class whenever the least accident occurs i feel inclined to ask myself whether the processionaries were not kept up there so long by the difficulties and dangers of the descent rather than by the lack of any gleam of intelligence in their benighted minds the facts however reply that the descent is as easy as the ascent the caterpillar has a very supple back well adapted for twisting round projections or slipping underneath he can walk with the same ease vertically or horizontally with his back down or up besides he never moves forward until he has fixed his thread to the ground with this support to his feet he has no falls to fear no matter what his position i had a proof of this before my eyes during a whole week as i have already said the track instead of keeping on one level bends twice dips at a certain point under the ledge of the vase and reappears at the top a little farther on at one part of the circuit therefore the procession walks on the lower surface of the rim and this inverted position implies so little discomfort or danger that it is renewed at each turn for all the caterpillars from first to last it is out of the question then to suggest the dread of a false step on the edge of the rim which is so nimbly turned at each point of inflexion the caterpillars in distress starved shelterless chilled with cold at night cling obstinately to the silk ribbon covered hundreds of times because they lack the rudimentary glimmers of reason which would advice them to abandon it experience and reflection are not in their province the ordeal of a five hundred yards march and three to four hundred turns teach them nothing and it takes casual circumstances to bring them back to the nest they would perish on their insidious ribbon if the disorder of the nocturnal encampments and the halts due to fatigue did not cast a few threads outside the circular path some three or four move along these trails laid without an object stray a little way and thanks to their wanderings prepare the descent which is at last accomplished in short strings favoured by chance the school most highly honoured today is very anxious to find the origin of reason in the dregs of the animal kingdom let me call its attention to the pine processionary the pine processionary meteorology in january a second moult occurs leaving the caterpillar less fair to the eye while at the same time endowing him with some very peculiar organs when the moment has come to shed their skins the processionaries cluster higgledypiggledy on the dome of the nest and there if the weather be mild remain motionless day and night it would seem as though the fact of their contact of their mutual discomfort while thus heaped together furnishes a resistance a fulcrum which favours the process of excoriation after this second moult the hairs on the middle of the back are of a dull reddish colour which is made paler still by the interposition of numerous long white hairs but this faded costume is accompanied by the singular organs which attracted the attention of réaumur who was greatly perplexed as to their function in the place originally occupied by the scarlet mosaic eight segments of the caterpillar are now cleft by a broad transversal gash a sort of thicklipped mouth which opens and gapes wide at the caterpillars will or closes without leaving a visible trace from each of these expanding mouths rises a tumour with a fine colourless skin as though the creature were exposing its tender inside and inflating it for the appearance is almost that which would be presented by the viscera protruding through skin incised by the scalpel two large darkbrown dots occupy the front face of the protuberance at the back are two short flat tufts of russet bristles which in the sunlight shine with a rich brilliancy all around is a radiating border of long white hairs spread almost flat this protuberance is extremely sensitive at the slightest irritation it goes in again and disappears under the dark integument in its place opens an oval crater a sort of huge stoma which swiftly brings its lips together closes and entirely disappears the long white hairs that form a moustache and imperial around this mouth follow the movements of the contracting lips after first radiating from a centre and lying flat these hairs rise like levelled wheat which the wind has caught from beneath and meet to form a transversal crest perpendicular to the creatures back this hairy erection produces a sudden modification in the caterpillars aspect the red shiny bristles have disappeared buried under the dark skin the white hairs now standing on end form a hirsute mane an ashy tinge has crept into the general colour of the costume when calm is restored as soon happens the slits open and yawn afresh the sensitive protuberances emerge quick to disappear once more should any cause for alarm occur these alternate expansions and contractions are rapidly repeated i provoke them at will in various ways a slight puff of tobaccosmoke immediately causes the stomata to yawn and the protuberances to emerge one would think that the insect was putting itself on its guard and displaying some special apparatus of information before long the protuberances go in again a second puff of smoke brings them out once more but if the smoke is too abundant too acrid the caterpillar wriggles and writhes without opening his apparatus or else i touch one or other of these uncovered protuberances very delicately with a bit of straw the pimple affected immediately contracts draws into itself like the horns of the snail and is replaced by a gaping mouth which in its turn closes usually but not always the segment excited by the contact of my straw is imitated by the others both front and back which close their apparatus one by one when undisturbed and in repose the caterpillar generally has his dorsal slits expanded in moving he sometimes opens and sometimes closes them in either case expansion and contraction are frequently repeated constantly coming together and retreating under the skin the lips of the mouthlike opening therefore end by losing their brittle moustaches of russet hairs which break off in this way a sort of dust collects at the bottom of the crater a dust formed of broken hairs which thanks to their barbs soon collect into little tufts when the slit expands rather suddenly the central projection shoots out on the insects sides its load of hairy remnants which the least breath blows into a cloud of golden atoms highly disagreeable to the observer i shall have something to say presently of the itch to which he is at such times exposed are these peculiar stomata designed merely to collect the adjoining bristles and to grind them to powder are these fineskinned papillæ which inflate and ascend from the depths of their hidingplace intended to get rid of the accumulation of broken hairs or is it the sole function of this peculiar apparatus to prepare at the expense of the caterpillars fleece an irritant dust which shall act as a means of defence nothing tells us so certainly the caterpillar is not armed against the enquirer who from time to time takes it into his head to come and examine him through a magnifyingglass it is even very doubtful whether he troubles at all about those passionate caterpillarlovers calosoma sycophanta 18 among insects and the cuckoo among birds those who consume such fare have a stomach expressly fashioned for the purpose a stomach that laughs at blistering hairs and possibly finds an appetizing stimulant in their sting no i do not see the motives that prompted the processionary to cleave his back with so many slits if he merely strips himself of his hair to throw an irritating dust in our eyes there must certainly be something else in question réaumur mentions these openings of which he made a brief study he calls them stigmata and is inclined to take them for exceptional breathingholes that they are not o my master no insect contrives airholes on its back moreover the magnifyingglass reveals no channel of communication with the interior respiration plays no part here the solution of the enigma must lie elsewhere the protuberances that rise from those expanded cavities are formed of a soft pale hairless membrane which gives the impression of a visceral hernia as though the caterpillar were wounded and exposing its delicate entrails to the air the sensitiveness just here is great the lightest touch with the point of a hairpencil causes the immediate indrawing of the protuberances and the closing of the containing lips the touch of a solid object even is not essential i pick up a tiny drop of water on the point of a pin and without shaking it off present this drop to the sensitive projection at the moment when contact occurs the apparatus contracts and closes up the recoil of the snails horns withdrawing the visual and olfactory organs into their sheaths is no prompter everything seems to prove that these optional tumours appearing and disappearing at the caterpillars will are instruments of sensorial perception the caterpillar exposes them to obtain information he shelters them under his skin to preserve their delicate functions now what is it that they perceive this is a difficult question in which the habits of the processionary alone can afford us a little guidance during the whole winter the pine caterpillars are active only at night in the daytime when the weather is fine they readily repair to the dome of the nest and there remain motionless gathered into heaps it is the hour of the openair siesta under the pale december and january sun as yet none leaves the home it is quite late in the evening towards nine oclock when they set out marching in an irregular procession to browse on the leaves of the branches hard by their grazing is a protracted affair the flock returns late some time after midnight when the temperature falls too low secondly it is in the heart of winter during the roughest months that the processionary displays his full activity indefatigably at this time of year he spins adding each night a new web to his silken tent at this time whenever the weather permits he ventures abroad on the neighbouring boughs to feed to grow and to renew his skein of silk by a very remarkable exception the harsh season marked by inactivity and lethargic repose in other insects is for him the season of bustle and labour on condition of course that the inclemencies of the weather do not exceed certain limits if the north wind blow too violently so that it is like to sweep the flock away if the cold be too piercing so that there is a risk of freezing to death if it snow or rain or if the mist thicken into an icy drizzle the caterpillars prudently stay at home sheltering under their weatherproof tent it would be convenient to some extent to foresee these inclemencies the caterpillar dreads them a drop of rain sets him in a flutter a snowflake exasperates him to start for the grazinggrounds at dark of night in uncertain weather would be dangerous for the procession goes some distance and travels slowly the flock would fare ill before regaining shelter did any sudden atmospheric trouble supervene an event of some frequency in the bad season of the year so that he may be informed in this particular during his nocturnal winter rambles can the pine caterpillar be endowed with some sort of meteorological aptitudes let us describe how the suspicion occurred to me divulged i know not how my rearing of caterpillars under glass acquired a certain renown it was talked about in the village the forestranger a sworn enemy to destructive insects wanted to see the grazing of the famous caterpillars of whom he had retained a too poignant memory ever since the day when he gathered and destroyed their nests in a pinewood under his charge it was arranged that he should call the same evening he arrives at the appointed hour accompanied by a friend for a moment we sit and chat in front of the fire then when the clock strikes nine the lantern is lit and we all three enter the greenhouse the visitors are eager for the spectacle of which they have heard such wonderful things while i am certain of satisfying their curiosity but but  what is this not a caterpillar on the nests not one on the fresh ration of branches last night and on the previous nights they came out in countless numbers tonight not one reveals himself can it be that they are merely late in going to dinner can their habitual punctuality be at fault because appetite has not yet arrived we must be patient ten oclock nothing eleven still nothing midnight was at hand when we abandoned our watch convinced that it would be vain to prolong the sitting you can imagine what an abject fool i looked at having thus to send my guests away next day i thought that i dimly perceived the explanation of this disappointment it rained in the night and again in the morning snow not the earliest of the year but so far the most abundant whitened the brow of the ventoux 19 had the caterpillars more sensitive than any of us to atmospheric changes refused to venture forth because they anticipated what was about to happen had they foreseen the rain and the snow which nothing seemed to announce at all events to us after all why not let us continue to observe them and we shall see whether the coincidence is fortuitous or not on this memorable day therefore the 13th of december 1895 i institute the caterpillars meteorological observatory i have at my disposal absolutely none of the apparatus dear to science not even a modest thermometer for my unlucky star continues in the ascendant proving as unkind today as when i learnt chemistry with pipebowls for crucibles and bottles that once contained sweets for retorts i confine myself to visiting nightly the processionaries in the greenhouse and those in the garden it is a hard task especially as i have to go to the far end of the enclosure often in weather when one would not turn a dog out of doors i set down the acts of the caterpillars whether they come out or stay at home i note the state of the sky during the day and at the moment of my evening examination to this list i add the meteorological chart of europe which the temps publishes daily if i want more precise data i request the normal school at avignon to send me on occasions of violent disturbances the barometrical records of its observatory these are the only documents at my disposal before we come to the results obtained let me once more repeat that my caterpillars meteorological institute has two stations one in the greenhouse and one in the open air on the pines in the enclosure the first protected against the wind and rain is that which i prefer it provides more regular and more continuous information in fact the openair caterpillars often enough refuse to come out even though the general conditions be favourable it is enough to keep them at home if there be too strong a wind shaking the boughs or even a little moisture dripping on the web of the nests saved from these two perils the greenhouse caterpillars have only to consider atmospheric incidents of a higher order the small variations escape them the great alone make an impression on them a most useful point for the observer and going a long way towards solving the problem for him the colonies under glass therefore provide most of the material for my notes the colonies in the open air add their testimony which is not always quite clear now what did they tell me those greenhouse caterpillars who on the 13th of december refused to show themselves to my guest the forestranger the rain that was to fall that night could hardly have alarmed them they were so well sheltered the snow about to whiten mont ventoux was nothing to them it was so far away moreover it was neither snowing yet nor raining some extraordinary atmospheric event profound and of vast extent must have been occurring the charts in the temps and the bulletin of the normal school told me as much a cyclonic disturbance coming from the british isles was passing over our district an atmospheric depression the like of which the season had not as yet known had spread in our direction reaching us on the 13th and persisting in a more or less accentuated form until the 22nd at avignon the barometer suddenly fell half an inch to 291 in on the 13th and lower still to 29 in on the 19th during this period of ten days the garden caterpillars made no sortie on the pinetrees true the weather was changeable there were a few showers of fine rain and some violent gusts of the mistral but more frequently there were days and nights when the sky was superb and the temperature moderate the prudent anchorites would not allow themselves to be caught the low pressure persisted menacing them and so they stopped at home in the greenhouse things happen rather differently sorties take place but the stayingin days are still more numerous it looks as though the caterpillars alarmed at first by the unexpected things happening overhead had reassured themselves and resumed work feeling nothing in their shelter of what they would have suffered out of doorsrain snow and furious mistral blastsand had then suspended their work again when the threats of bad weather increased there is indeed a fairly accurate agreement between the oscillations of the barometer and the decisions of the herd when the column of mercury rises a little they come out when it falls they remain at home thus on the 19th the night of the lowest pressure 29 in not a caterpillar ventures outside as the wind and rain can have no effect on my colonies under glass one is led to suppose that atmospheric pressure with its physiological results so difficult to define is here the principal factor as for the temperature within moderate limits there is no need to discuss it the processionaries have a robust constitution as behoves spinners who work in the open air in midwinter however piercing the cold so long as it does not freeze when the hour comes for working or feeding they spin on the surface of the nest or browse on the neighbouring branches another example according to the meteorological chart in the temps a depression whose centre is near the iles sanguinaires at the entrance of the gulf of ajaccio reaches my neighbourhood with a minimum of 292 in on the 9th of january a tempestuous wind gets up for the first time this year there is a respectable frost the ice on the large pond in the garden is two or three inches thick this wild weather lasts for five days of course the garden caterpillars do not sally forth on the pinetrees while these are battered by such a gale the remarkable part of the business is that the greenhouse caterpillars do not venture out of their nests either and yet for them there are no boughs dangerously shaken no cold piercing beyond endurance for it is not freezing under the glass what keeps them in can be only the passage of that wave of depression on the 15th the storm ceases and the barometer remains between 296 and 30 in for the rest of the month and a good part of february during this long period there are magnificent sorties every evening especially in the greenhouse on the 23rd and 24th of february suddenly the processionaries stop at home again for no apparent reason of the six nests under cover only two have a few rare caterpillars out on the pinebranches while previously in the case of all six i used every night to see the leaves bending under the weight of an innumerable multitude warned by this forecast i enter in my notes some deep depression is about to reach us and i have guessed right two days later sure enough the meteorological record of the temps gives me the following information a minimum of 292 in coming from the bay of biscay on the 22nd reaches algeria on the 23rd and spreads over the provence coast on the 24th there is a heavy snowfall at marseilles on the 25th    the ships i read in my paper present a curious spectacle with     their yards and rigging white that is how the people of     marseilles little used to such sights picture spitzbergen and the     north pole here certainly is the gale which my caterpillars foresaw when they refused to go out last night and the night before here is the centre of disturbance which revealed itself at sérignan by a violent and icy north wind on the 25th and the following days again i perceive that the greenhouse caterpillars are alarmed only at the approach of the wave of atmospheric disturbance once the first uneasiness caused by the depression had abated they came out again on the 25th and the following days in the midst of the gale as though nothing extraordinary were happening from the sum of my observations it appears that the pine processionary is eminently sensitive to atmospheric vicissitudes an excellent quality having regard to his way of life in the sharp winter nights he foresees the storm which would imperil his excursions his capacity for scenting bad weather very soon won the confidence of the household when we had to go into orange to renew our provisions it became the rule to consult him the night before and according to his verdict we went or stayed at home his oracle never deceived us in the same way simple folk that we were we used in the old days to interrogate the dorbeetle 20 another doughty nocturnal worker but a little demoralized by imprisonment in a cage and apparently devoid of any special sensitive apparatus performing his evolutions moreover in the mild autumn evenings the celebrated dungbeetle could never rival the pine caterpillar who is active during the roughest season of the year and endowed as everything would seem to affirm with organs quick to perceive the great atmospheric fluctuations rural lore abounds in meteorological forecasts derived from animals the cat sitting in front of the fire and washing behind her ears with a salivasmeared paw foretells another cold snap the cock crowing at unusual hours announces the return of fine weather the guineafowl with her screeching as of a scythe on the grindstone points to rain the hen standing on one leg her plumage ruffled her head sunk on her neck feels a hard frost coming the pretty green treefrog inflates his throat like a bladder at the approach of a storm and according to the provençal peasant says ploùra ploùra it will rain it will rain this rustic meteorology the heritage of the centuries does not show up so badly beside our scientific meteorology are not we ourselves living barometers every veteran complains of his glorious scars when the weather is about to break one man though unwounded suffers from insomnia or from bad dreams another though a brainworker cannot drag an idea out of his impotent head each of us in his own way is tried by the passage of those huge funnels which form in the atmosphere and hatch the storm could the insect with its exceptionally delicate organization escape this kind of impression it is unbelievable the insect more than any other creature should be an animated meteorological instrument as truthful in its forecasts if we knew how to read them as the lifeless instruments of our observatories with their mercury and their catgut all in different degrees possess a general impressionability analogous to our own and exercised without the aid of specific organs some bettergifted because of their mode of life might well be furnished with special meteorological apparatus the pine processionary seems to belong to this number in his second costume when the segments bear on their dorsal faces an elegant red mosaic he differs apparently from other caterpillars only by a more delicate general impressionability unless this mosaic be endowed with aptitudes unknown elsewhere if the nocturnal spinner is still none too generously equipped it must be remembered that the season which he passes in this condition is nearly always clement the really formidable nights hardly set in before january but then as a safeguard in his peregrinations the pine processionary cleaves his back with a series of mouths which yawn open to sample the air from time to time and to give a warning of the sudden storm until further evidence is forthcoming therefore the dorsal slits are to my mind meteorological instruments barometers influenced by the main fluctuations of the atmosphere to go beyond suspicions though these are well based is for me impossible i lack the equipment necessary to delve more deeply into the subject but i have given a hint it is for those who are better favoured in the matter of resources to find the final solution of this interesting problem the pine processionary the moth when march comes the caterpillars reared in domesticity never cease processioning many leave the greenhouse which remains open they go in search of a suitable spot for the approaching metamorphosis this is the final exodus the definite abandonment of the nest and the pinetree the pilgrims are much faded whitish with a few russet hairs on their backs on the 20th of march i spend a whole morning watching the evolutions of a file some three yards in length containing about a hundred emigrants the procession toils grimly along undulating over the dusty ground where it leaves a furrow then it breaks into a small number of groups which crowd together and remain quiescent save for sudden oscillations of the hindquarters after a halt of varying duration these groups resume their march henceforward forming independent processions they take no settled direction this one goes forward that one goes back one turns to the left and another to the right there is no rule about their marching no positive goal one procession after describing a loop retraces its steps yet there is a general tendency towards that wall of the greenhouse which faces the south and reflects the suns rays with added fervour the sole guide it would seem is the amount of sun which a place obtains the directions whence the greatest heat comes are preferred after a couple of hours of marching and countermarching the fragmentary processions comprising each a score of caterpillars reach the foot of the wall here the soil is powdery very dry easy to burrow in although made somewhat firmer by tufts of grass the caterpillar at the head of the row explores with his mandibles digs a little investigates the nature of the ground the others trusting their leader follow him with docility making no attempts of their own whatever the foremost decides will be adopted by all here in the choice of a matter so important as the spot whereat the transformation shall take place there is no individual initiative there is only one will the leaders there is only one head so to speak the procession may be compared with the chain of segments of an enormous worm finally some spot is recognized as propitious the leading caterpillar halts pushes with his head digs with his mandibles the others still in a continuous line arrive one by one and likewise come to a halt then the file breaks up into a swarming heap in which each of the caterpillars resumes his liberty all their backs are joggling pellmell all their heads are plunged into the dust all their feet are raking all their mandibles excavating the soil the worm has chopped itself into a gang of independent workers an excavation is formed in which little by little the caterpillars bury themselves for some time to come the undermined soil cracks and rises and covers itself with little molehills then all is still the caterpillars have descended to a depth of three inches this is as far as the roughness of the soil permits them to go in looser soil the excavation would attain a much greater depth the greenhouse shelf supplied with fine sand has provided me with cocoons placed at a depth of from eight to twelve inches i would not assert that the interment might not be made still lower down for the most part the burial is effected in common by more or less numerous clusters and at depths which vary greatly according to the nature of the soil a fortnight later let us dig at the point where the descent underground was made here we shall find the cocoons assembled in bunches cocoons of sorry appearance soiled as they are with earthy particles held by silken threads when stripped of their rough exterior they are not without a certain elegance they are narrow ellipsoids pointed at both ends measuring twentyfive millimetres in length and nine millimetres 21 in thickness the silk of which they are composed is very fine and of a dull white the fragility of the walls is remarkable when we have seen the enormous quantity of silk expended on the construction of the nest a prodigious spinner where his winter habitation is concerned the caterpillar finds his glands exhausted and is reduced to the strictly necessary amount when the time comes for making the cocoon too poor in silk he strengthens his flimsy cell with a facing of earth with him it is not the industry of the bembex 22 who inserts grains of sand in her silky web and makes a solid casket of the whole it is a summary sort of art devoid of delicacy which just casually sticks together the surrounding earthy refuse moreover if circumstances demand it the pine caterpillar can do without earth in the very midst of the nest i have sometimesvery rarely it is truediscovered cocoons which were perfectly clean not a scrap of alien matter defiled their fine white silk i have obtained similar specimens by placing caterpillars under a bellglass in a pan provided only with a few pinetwigs better still an entire procession a goodsized one too gathered at the opportune moment and enclosed in a large box containing no sand nor any material whatever spun its cocoons with no other support than the bare walls these exceptions provoked by circumstances in which the caterpillar is not free to act according to his wont does not in any way invalidate the rule to prepare for the transformation the processionary buries himself to the depth of nine inches and more if the soil permit here a curious problem forces itself upon the observers mind how does the moth contrive to ascend from the catacombs into which the caterpillar has descended not in the finery of her perfect statethe big wings with their delicate scales the sweeping antennaplumesdare she brave the asperities of the soil or she would issue thence all tattered rumpled and unrecognizable and this is not the case far from it moreover what means can she employ she so feeble to break the crust of earth into which the original dust will have turned after the slightest of showers the moth appears at the end of july or in august the burial took place in march rain must have fallen during this lapse of time rain which beats down the soil cements it and leaves it to harden once evaporation has set in never could a moth unless attired and equipped with tools for the purpose break her way through such an obstacle she would perforce require a boringtool and a costume of extreme simplicity guided by these considerations i institute a few experiments which will give me the key to the riddle in april i make a copious collection of cocoons of these i place ten or twelve at the bottom of testtubes of different diameters and last of all i fill the apparatus with sandy soil sifted and very slightly moistened the contents are pressed down but in moderation for fear of injuring the cocoons below when the month of august comes the column of earth damp at the outset has set so firmly thanks to evaporation that when i reverse the testtube nothing trickles out on the other hand some cocoons have been kept naked under a metallic cover these will teach me what the buried cocoons would not be able to show they furnish me in fact with records of the greatest interest on issuing from the cocoon the pine bombyx has her finery bundled up and presents the appearance of a cylinder with rounded ends the wings the principal obstacle to underground labour are pressed against the breast like narrow scarves the antennæ another serious embarrassment have not yet unfolded their plumes and are turned back along the moths sides the hair which later forms a dense fleece is laid flat pointing backwards the legs alone are free fairly active and endowed with a certain vigour thanks to this arrangement which does away with all awkward projections the ascent through the soil is made possible true every moth at the moment of quitting her shell is this sort of swathed mummy but the pine bombyx has in addition an exceptional aptitude rendered necessary by the fact that she hatches under the ground while the others once out of the cocoon hasten to spread their wings and are powerless to defer their development she by virtue of an indispensable privilege remains in her compact and wrappedup condition as long as circumstances demand it under my bellglasses i see some who though born upon the surface for twentyfour hours drag themselves over the sand or cling to the pinebranches before untying their sashes and unfurling them as wings this delay is evidently essential to ascend from beneath the earth and reach the open air the moth has to bore a long tunnel which requires time she will take good care not to spread her finery before emerging for it would hamper her and would itself be rumpled and badly creased therefore the cylindrical mummy persists until the deliverance is effected and if liberty happen to be acquired before the appointed moment the final evolution does not take place until after a lapse of time in conformity with usage we are acquainted with the equipment for emergence the tightfitting jerkin indispensable in a narrow gallery now where is the boringtool the legs though free would here be insufficient they would scrape the earth laterally enlarging the diameter of the shaft but could not prolong the exit vertically above the insects head this tool must be in front pass the tip of your finger over the moths head you will feel a few very rough wrinkles the magnifyingglass shows us more we find between the eyes and higher up four or five transversal scales so set as to overlap one another they are hard and black and are trimmed crescentwise at the ends the longest and strongest is the uppermost which is in the middle of the forehead there you have the centrebit of your boringtool to make our tunnels in granitic rocks we tip our drills with diamond points for a similar task the bombyx a living drill wears implanted on her forehead a row of crescents hard and durable as steel a regular twistbit without suspecting its use réaumur was perfectly aware of this marvellous implement which he called scaly stairs what does it profit this moth he asks that she should thus have the front of her head formed like scaly stairs that is just what i do not know my testtubes learned master will tell us by good fortune of the numerous moths ascending from the bottom of my apparatus through a column of sand solidified by the evaporation of the original moisture some are making their way upwards against the side of the tube enabling me to follow their manœuvres i see them raising their cylindrical bodies butting with their heads jerking now in one direction now in another the nature of their task is obvious the centrebits with an alternating movement are boring into the agglutinated sand the powdery wreckage trickles down from overhead and is at once thrust backward by the legs a little space forms at the top of the vault and the moth moves so much nearer to the surface by the following day the whole column ten inches in height will be perforated with a straight perpendicular shaft shall we now form an idea of the total work performed let us turn the testtube upside down the contents as i have said will not fall out for they have set into a block but from the tunnels bored by the moth trickles all the sand crumbled by the crescents of the drill the result is a cylindrical gallery of the width of a leadpencil very cleanly cut and reaching to the bottom of the solid mass are you satisfied my master do you now perceive the great utility of the scaly stairs would you not say that we have here a magnificent example of an instrument superlatively fitted for a definite task i share this opinion for i think with you that a sovereign reason has in all things coordinated the means and the end but let me tell you we are called oldfashioned you and i with our conception of a world ruled by an intelligence we are quite out of the swim order balance harmony that is all silly nonsense the universe is a fortuitous arrangement in the chaos of the possible what is white might as easily be black what is round might be angular what is regular might be shapeless and harmony might just as well be discord chance has decided all things yes we are a pair of prejudiced old fogeys when we linger with a certain fondness over the marvels of perfection who troubles about these futilities nowadays socalled serious science the science which spells honour profit and renown consists in slicing your animal with very costly instruments into tiny circular sections my housekeeper does as much with a bunch of carrots with no higher pretension than to concoct a modest dish which is not an invariable success in the problem of life are we more successful when we have split a fibre into four and cut a cell into shavings it hardly seems so the riddle is as dark as ever ah how much better is your method my dear master above all how much loftier your philosophy how much more wholesome and invigorating here at last is the moth at the surface with the deliberate slowness demanded by so delicate an operation she spreads her bunched wings extends her antennæ and puffs out her fleece her costume is a modest one upper wings grey striped with a few crinkly brown streaks underwings white thorax covered with thick grey fur abdomen clad in brightrusset velvet the last segment has a palegold sheen at first sight it appears bare it is not however but in place of hairs like those of the other segments it has on its dorsal surface scales so well assembled and so close together that the whole seems to form a continuous block like a nugget let us touch this trinket with the point of a needle however gently we rub a multitude of scales come off and flutter at the least breath shining like mica spangles their concave form their shape an elongated oval their colouring white in the lower half but reddish gold in the upper give them if we allow for the difference in size a certain resemblance to the scales surrounding the heads of some of the centaury tribe such is the golden fleece of which the mother will despoil herself in order to cover the cylinder of her eggs the nugget of her hindquarters exfoliated spangle by spangle will form a roof for the germs arranged like the grain in a corncob i was anxious to watch the actual placing of these pretty tiles which are fixed at the pale end with a speck of cement leaving the coloured end free circumstances did not favour me inactive all day motionless on some needle of the lower branches the moth whose life is very short moves only in the darkness of the night both her mating and egglaying are nocturnal on the morrow all is finished the bombyx has lived under these conditions it was impossible by the doubtful beams of a lantern to follow satisfactorily the labour of the mother on the pinetrees in the garden i was no more fortunate with the captives in my bellglasses a few did lay their eggs but always at a very advanced hour of the night an hour which found my vigilance at fault the light of a candle and eyes heavy with sleep were of little avail when it came to analysing the subtle operations of the mother as she puts her scales in place we will say nothing of the little that was imperfectly seen let us close with a few words of sylvicultural practice the pine processionary is a voracious caterpillar who while respecting the terminal bud protected by its scales and its resinous varnish completely denudes the bough and imperils the tree by leaving it bald the green pineneedles that mane in which the vegetable vigour of the tree resides are shorn to the roots how are we to remedy this when consulted on the subject the forestranger of my parish told me that the custom is to go from tree to tree with pruningshears fitted on a long pole and to cut down the nests afterwards burning them the method is a troublesome one for the silken purses are often at considerable heights moreover it is not without danger attacked by the hairy dust the destroyers soon experience intolerable discomfort a torture of irritation which makes them refuse to continue the work to my thinking it would be better to operate before the appearance of the nests the pine bombyx is a very bad flyer incapable of soaring almost like the silkmoth she flutters about and blunders to earth again and her best efforts barely succeed in bringing her to the lower branches which almost drag along the ground here are deposited the cylinders of eggs at a height of six feet at most it is the young caterpillars who from one provisional encampment to another gradually ascend attaining stage by stage the summits upon which they weave their final dwellings once we grasp this peculiarity the rest is plain sailing in august we inspect the lower foliage of the tree an easy examination for it is carried on no higher than our heads towards the far end of the twigs it is easy to espy the bombyx eggs packed into cylinders that resemble scaly catkins their size and their whitish colour make them show up amid the sombre green gathered with the double pineneedle that bears them these cylinders are crushed under foot a summary fashion of stamping out an evil before it spreads this i have done in the case of the few pinetrees in my enclosure and the same might be done in the wider forest expanses and more especially in parks and gardens where symmetrical foliation is one of the great beauties of the tree i will add that it is wise to prune every bough that droops to earth and to keep the foot of the conifer bare to a height of six feet or so in the absence of these lower stairs the only ones that the bombyx with her clumsy flight can reach she will not be able to populate the tree the pine processionary the stinging power the pine processionary has three costumes that of infancy a scanty ragged fleece a mixture of black and white that of middle age the richest of the three when the segments deck themselves on their dorsal surface with golden tufts and a mosaic of bare patches scarlet in colour and that of maturity when the rings are cleft by slits which one by one open and close their thick lips champing and grinding their bristling russet beards and chewing them into little pellets which are thrown out on the creatures sides when the bottom of the pocket swells up like a tumour when wearing this last costume the caterpillar is very disagreeable to handle or even to observe at close quarters i happened quite unexpectedly to learn this more thoroughly than i wished after unsuspectingly passing a whole morning with my insects stooping over them magnifyingglass in hand to examine the working of their slits i found my forehead and eyelids suffering with redness for twentyfour hours and afflicted with an itching even more painful and persistent than that produced by the sting of a nettle on seeing me come down to dinner in this sad plight with my eyes reddened and swollen and my face unrecognizable the family anxiously enquired what had happened to me and were not reassured until i told them of my mishap i unhesitatingly attribute my painful experience to the red hairs ground to powder and collected into flakes my breath sought them out in the open pockets and carried them to my face which was very near the unthinking intervention of my hands which now and again sought to ease the discomfort merely aggravated the ill by spreading the irritating dust no the search for truth on the back of the processionary is not all sunshine it was only after a nights rest that i found myself pretty well recovered the incident having no further ill effects let us continue however it is well to substitute premeditated experiments for chance facts the little pockets of which the dorsal slits form the entrance are encumbered as i have said with hairy refuse either scattered or gathered into flakes with the point of a paintbrush i collect when they gape open a little of their contents and rub it on my wrist or on the inside of my forearm i have not long to wait for the result soon the skin turns red and is covered with pale lenticular swellings similar to those produced by a nettlesting without being very sharp the pain was extremely unpleasant by the following day itching redness and lenticular swellings had all disappeared this is the usual sequence of events but let me not omit to say that the experiment does not always succeed the efficacy of the fluffy dust appears subject to great variations there have been occasions when i have rubbed myself with the whole caterpillar or with his cast skin or with the broken hairs gathered on a paintbrush without producing any unpleasant results the irritant dust seems to vary in quality according to certain circumstances which i have not been able to discover from my various tests it is evident that the discomfort is caused by the delicate hairs which the lips of the dorsal mouths gaping and closing again never cease grinding to the detriment of their beards and moustaches the edges of these slits as their bristles rub off furnish the stinging dust having established this fact let us proceed to more serious experiments in the middle of march when the processionaries for the most part have migrated underground i decide to open a few nests as i wish to collect their last inhabitants for the purpose of my investigations without taking any precautions my fingers tug at the silken dwelling which is made of solid stuff they tear it into shreds search it through and through turn it inside out and back again once more and this time in a more serious fashion i am the victim of my unthinking enthusiasm hardly is the operation completed when the tips of my fingers begin to hurt in good earnest especially in the more delicate part protected by the edge of the nail the feeling is like the sharp pain of a sore that is beginning to fester all the rest of the day and all through the night the pain persists troublesome enough to rob me of my sleep it does not quiet down until the following day after twentyfour hours of petty torment how did this new misadventure befall me i had not handled the caterpillars indeed there were very few of them in the nest at the time i had come upon no shed skins for the moults do not take place inside the silken purse when the moment has come to doff the second costume that of the red mosaic the caterpillars cluster outside on the dome of their dwelling and there leave in a single heap their old clothes entangled with bits of silk what is left to explain the unpleasant consequences to which the handling of the nest exposes us the broken red bristles are left the fallen hairs forming a dust that is invisible without a very careful examination for a long time the processionaries crawl and swarm about the nest they pass to and fro penetrating the thickness of the wall when they go to the pastures and when they return to their dormitory whether motionless or on the move they are constantly opening and closing their apparatus of information the dorsal mouths at the moment of closing the lips of these slits rolling on each other like the cylinders of a flatteningmill catch hold of the fluff near them tear it out and break it into fragments which the bottom of the pocket presently reascending shoots outside thus myriads of irritant particles are disseminated and subtly introduced into every part of the nest the shirt of nessus burnt the veins of whoso wore it the silk of the processionary another poisoned fabric sets on fire the fingers that handle it the loathsome hairs long retain their virulence i was once sorting out some handfuls of cocoons many of which were diseased as the hardness of the contents was usually an indication that something was wrong i tore open the doubtful cocoons with my fingers in order to save the noncontaminated chrysalids my sorting was rewarded with the same kind of pain especially under the edges of the nails as i had already suffered when tearing the nests the cause of the irritation on this occasion was sometimes the dry skin discarded by the processionary on becoming a chrysalis and sometimes the shrivelled caterpillar turned into a sort of chalky cylinder through the invasion of the malignant fungus six months later these wretched cocoons were still capable of producing redness and irritation examined under the microscope the russet hairs the cause of the itching are stiff rods very sharp at either end and armed with barbs along the upper half their structure has absolutely nothing in common with nettlehairs those tapering phials whose hard point snaps off pouring an irritant fluid into the tiny wound the plant from whose latin name urtica we derive the word urtication borrowed the design of its weapon from the fangs of the venomous serpents it obtains its effect not by the wound but by the poison introduced into the wound the processionary employs a different method the hairs which have naught resembling the ampullary reservoir of the nettlehairs must be poisoned on the surface like the assegais of the kafirs and zulus do they really penetrate the epidermis are they like the savages javelin which cannot be extracted once it has gone in with their barbs do they enter all the more deeply because of the quivering of the outraged flesh there is no ground for believing anything of the kind in vain do i scrutinize the injured spot through the magnifyingglass i can see no sign of the implanted dart neither could réaumur when an encounter with the oak processionary set him scratching himself he had his suspicions but could state nothing definitely no despite their sharp points and their barbs which make them under the microscope such formidable spears the processionarys russet hairs are not darts designed to imbed themselves in the skin and to provoke irritation by pricking many caterpillars all most inoffensive have a coat of bristles which under the microscope resolve themselves into barbed javelins quite harmless in spite of their threatening aspect let me mention a couple of these peaceable halberdiers early in spring we see crossing the paths a brisklymoving caterpillar who inspires repugnance by his ferocious hairiness which ripples like ripe corn the ancient naturalists with their artless and picturesque nomenclature called him the hedgehog the term is worthy of the creature which in the moment of danger rolls itself up like a hedgehog presenting its spiny armour on all sides to the enemy on its back is a dense mixture of black hairs and hairs of ashengray while on the sides and forepart of the body is a stiff mane of bright russet black grey or russet all this fiercelooking coat is heavily barbed one hesitates to touch this horror with the fingertips still encouraged by my example sevenyearold paul with his tender childs skin gathers handfuls of the repulsive insect with no more apprehension than if he were picking a bunch of violets he fills his boxes with it he rears it on elmleaves and handles it daily for he knows that from this frightful creature he will one day obtain a superb moth chelonia caja linn clad in scarlet velvet with the lower wings red and the upper white sprinkled with brown spots what resulted from the childs familiarity with the shaggy creature not even a trace of itching on his delicate skin i do not speak of mine which is tanned by the years in the osierbeds of our local stream the rushing aygues a thorny shrub abounds which at the advent of autumn is covered with an infinity of very sour red berries its crabbed boughs which bear but little verdure are hidden under their clusters of vermilion balls it is the sallow thorn or sea buckthorn hippophaë rhamnoides in april a very hairy but rather pretty caterpillar lives at the expense of this shrubs budding leaves he has on his back five dense tufts of hair set side by side and arranged like the bristles of a brush tufts deepblack in the centre and white at the edges he waves two divergent plumes in front of him and sports a third on his crupper like a feathery tail these three are black hairpencils of extreme delicacy his greyish moth flattened motionless on the bark stretches his long forelegs one against the other in front of him you would take them at a first glance for antennae of exaggerated proportions this pose of the extended limbs has won the insect the scientific label of orgyia arms length and also the vulgar and more expressive denomination of patte étendue or outstretched paw little paul has not failed with my aid to rear the pretty bearer of the tufts and brushes how many times with his sensitive finger has he not stroked the creatures furry costume he found it softer than velvet and yet enlarged under the microscope the caterpillars hairs are horrible barbed spears no less menacing than those of the processionary the resemblance goes no farther handled without precautions the tufted caterpillar does not provoke even a simple rash nothing could be more harmless than his coat it is evident then that the cause of the irritation lies elsewhere than in the barbs if the barbed bristles were enough to poison the fingers most hairy caterpillars would be dangerous for nearly all have spiny bristles we find on the contrary that virulence is bestowed upon a very small number which are not distinguished from the rest by any special structure of the hair that the barbs have a part to play that of fixing the irritant atom upon the epidermis of keeping it anchored in its place is after all possible but the shooting pains cannot by any means be caused by the mere prick of so delicate a harpoon much less slender the hairs clustered into pads on the prickly pears are ferociously barbed woe to the fingers that handle this kind of velvet too confidently at the least touch they are pierced with harpoons whose extraction involves a severe tax upon our patience other inconvenience there is little or none for the action of the barb is in this case purely mechanical supposinga very doubtful thingthat the processionarys hairs could penetrate our skin they would act likewise only with less effect if they had merely their sharp points and their barbs what then do they possess in addition they must have not inside them like the hairs of the nettle but outside on the surface an irritant agent they must be coated with a poisonous mixture which makes them act by simple contact let us remove this virus by means of a solvent and the processionarys darts reduced to their insignificant mechanical action will be harmless the solvent on the other hand rid of all hairs by filtration will be charged with the irritant element which we shall be able to test without the agency of the hairs isolated and concentrated the stinging element far from losing by this treatment ought to gain in virulence so reflection tells us the solvents tried are confined to three water spirits of wine and sulphuric ether i employ the latter by preference although the other two spirits of wine especially have yielded satisfactory results to simplify the experiment instead of submitting to the action of the solvent the entire caterpillar who would complicate the extract with his fats and his nutritive juices i prefer to employ the cast skin alone i therefore collect on the one hand the heap of dry skins which the moult of the second phase has left on the dome of the silken dwelling and on the other hand the skins which the caterpillars have rejected in their cocoons before becoming chrysalids and i leave the two lots to infuse separately in sulphuric ether for twentyfour hours the infusion is colourless the liquid carefully filtered is exposed to spontaneous evaporation and the skins are rinsed with ether in the filter several times over there are now two tests to be made one with the skins and one with the product of maceration the first is as conclusive as can be hairy as in the normal state and perfectly dried the skins of both lots drained by the ether produce not the slightest effect although i rub myself with them without the least caution at the juncture of the fingers a spot very sensitive to stinging the hairs are the same as before the action of the solvent they have lost none of their barbs of their javelinpoints and yet they are ineffectual they produce no pain or inconvenience whatever deprived of their toxic smearing these thousands of darts become so much harmless velvet the hedgehog caterpillar and the brush caterpillar are not more inoffensive the second test is more positive and so conclusive in its painful effects that one hardly likes to try it a second time when the ethereal infusion is reduced by spontaneous evaporation to a few drops i soak in it a slip of blottingpaper folded in four so as to form a square measuring something over an inch too unsuspecting of my product i do things on a lavish scale both as regards the superficial area of my poor epidermis and the quantity of the virus to any one who might wish to renew the investigation i should recommend a less generous dose lastly the square of paper that novel sort of mustardplaster is applied to the under surface of the forearm a thin waterproof sheeting covers it to prevent it from drying too rapidly and a bandage holds it in place for the space of ten hours i feel nothing then i experience an increasing itch and a burning sensation acute enough to keep me awake for the greater part of the night next day after twentyfour hours of contact the poultice is removed a red mark slightly swollen and very clearly outlined occupies the square which the poisoned paper covered the skin feels sore as though it had been cauterized and looks as rough as shagreen from each of its tiny pustules trickles a drop of serous fluid which hardens into a substance similar in colour to gumarabic this oozing continues for a couple of days and more then the inflammation abates the pain hitherto very trying quiets down the skin dries and comes off in little flakes all is over except the red mark which remains for a long time so tenacious in its effects is this extract of processionary three weeks after the experiment the little square on the forearm subjected to the poison is still discoloured for thus branding ones self does one at least obtain some small reward yes a little truth is the balm spread upon the wound and indeed truth is a sovran balm it will come presently to solace us for much greater sufferings for the moment this painful experiment shows us that the irritation has not as its primary cause the hairiness of the processionary here is no hair no barb no dart all of that has been retained by the filter we have nothing now but a poisonous agent extracted by the solvent the ether this irritant element recalls to a certain extent that of cantharides which acts by simple contact my square of poisoned blottingpaper was a sort of plaster which instead of raising the epidermis in great blisters makes it bristle with tiny pustules the part played by the barbed hairs those atoms which the least movement of the air disseminates in all directions is confined to conveying to our face and hands the irritant substance in which they are impregnated their barbs hold them in place and thus permit the virus to act it is even probable that by means of slight scratches which would otherwise pass unnoticed they assist the action of the stinging fluid shortly after handling the processionaries a delicate epidermis becomes tumefied red and painful without being immediate the action of the caterpillar is prompt the extract made with ether on the other hand causes pain and rubefaction only after a longish interval what does it need to produce more rapid ulceration to all appearances the action of the hairs the direct stinging caused by the caterpillar is nothing like so serious as that produced by the ethereal extract concentrated in a few drops never before in my most painful misadventures whether with the silken purses or their inhabitants have i seen my skin covered with serous pustules and peeling off in flakes this time it is a veritable sore anything but pleasing to the eye the aggravation is easily explained i soaked in the ether some fifty discarded skins the few drops which remained after the evaporation and which were absorbed by the square of blottingpaper represented therefore the virulence of a single insect fifty times increased my little blisteringplaster was equivalent to the contact of fifty caterpillars at the same spot there is no doubt that if we left them to steep in considerable numbers we should obtain extracts of really formidable strength it is quite possible that medical science will one day make good use of this powerful counterirritant which is utterly different from cantharides whether voluntary victims of our curiosity which while affording no other satisfaction than that of knowledge exposes us to an intolerable itch or sufferers through an accident what can we do to give a little relief to the irritation caused by the processionary it is good to know the origin of the evil but it would be better to apply a remedy one day with both hands sore from the prolonged examination of a nest i try without success lotions of alcohol glycerine oil and soapsuds nothing does any good i then remember a palliative employed by réaumur against the sting of the oak processionary without telling us how he came to know of the strange specific the master rubbed himself with parsley and felt a good deal the better for it he adds that any other leaf would probably assuage the irritation in the same way this is a fitting occasion for reopening the subject here in a corner of the garden is parsley green and abundant as one could wish what other plant can we compare with it i choose the purslain the spontaneous guest of my vegetablebeds mucilaginous and fleshy as it is it readily crushes yielding an emollient liniment i rub one hand with parsley and the other with purslain pressing hard enough to reduce the leaves to a paste the result deserves attention with the parsley the burning is a little less acute it is true but though relieved it persists for a long time yet and continues troublesome with the purslain the petty torture ceases almost at once and so completely that i no longer notice it my nostrum possesses incontestable virtues i recommend it quietly without blatant advertisement to any one who may be persecuted by the processionary foresters in their war upon caterpillars nests should find great relief from it i have also obtained good results with the leaves of the tomato and the lettuce and without pursuing this botanical survey further i remain convinced with réaumur that any tender juicy foliage would possess a certain efficacy as for the mode of action of this specific i admit that i do not understand it any more than i can perceive the mode of action of the caterpillars virus molières medical student explained the soporific properties of opium by saying quia est in eo virtus dormitava cujus est proprietas sensus assoupire let us say likewise the crushed herb calms the burning itch because it possesses a calming virtue whose property is to assuage itching the quip is a good deal more philosophical than it looks what do we know of our remedies or of anything we perceive effects but we cannot get back to their causes in my village and for some distance around it there is a popular belief that to relieve the pain of a wasps or bees sting all that we need do is to rub the part stung with three sorts of herbs take they say three kinds of herbs the first that come to hand make them into a bunch and rub hard the prescription by all accounts is infallible i thought at first that this was one of those therapeutic absurdities which have their birth in rustic imaginations after making a trial i admit that what sounds like a nonsensical remedy sometimes has something genuine about it friction with three kinds of herbs does actually deaden the sting of the wasp or bee i hasten to add that the same success is achieved with a single herb and so the result agrees with what the parsley and purslain have taught us in respect of the irritation caused by the processionary why three herbs when one is enough three is the preeminently lucky number it smacks of witchcraft which is far from detracting from the virtues of the unguent all rustic medicine has a touch of magic about it and there is merit in doing things by threes perhaps the specific of the three herbs may even date back to the materia medica of antiquity dioscorides recommends τρίφυλλον it is he states good for the bite of venomous serpents to determine this celebrated threeleaved plant exactly would not be easy is it a common clover the psoralea with its pitchy odour the menyanthes or uckbean that inmate of the chilly peatbogs the oxalis the woodsorrel of the countryside we cannot tell for certain the botany of those days was innocent of the descriptive conscientiousness of ours the plant which acted as a poisonantidote grouped its leaves by threes that is its essential characteristic again the cabalistic number essential to medical virtues as conceived by the first healers the peasant a tenacious conservative has preserved the ancient remedy but by a happy inspiration has changed the three original leaves into three different herbs he has elaborated the τρίφυλλον into the threefold foliage which he crushes on the bees sting i seem to perceive a certain relation between these artless ways and the crushing of parsley as described by réaumur the arbutus caterpillar i have not found many species of urticating caterpillars in the small corner of my investigations i know of two only the pine caterpillar and the arbutus caterpillar the latter belongs to the genus liparis his moth who is a glorious snowy white with the last rings of the abdomen bright russet is very like liparis auriflua fab from whom she differs not only in sizeshe is smallerbut above all in the field of operations selected by her caterpillar is the species classified in our lists i do not know and really it is hardly worth while to enquire what does a latin name matter when one cannot mistake the insect i shall be sparing of detail concerning the arbutus caterpillar for he is far less interesting in his habits than the pine processionary only his ravages and his poison deserve serious attention on the sérignan hills sunny heights upon which the mediterranean vegetation comes to an end the arbutus or strawberrytree abounds a magnificent shrub with lustrous evergreen foliage vermilion fruit round and fleshy as strawberries and hanging clusters of little white bells resembling those of the lily of the valley when the frosts come at the approach of december nothing could be more charming than the arbutus decking its gay verdure with both fruits and flowers with coral balls and plump little bells alone of our flora it combines the flowering of today with the ripening of yesterday then the brightred raspberriesthe darbouses as we call them herebeloved by the blackbird grow soft and sweet to the palate the housewives pluck them and make them into preserves that are not without merit as for the shrub itself when the season for cutting has come it is not despite its beauty respected by the woodman it serves like any trivial brushwood in the making of faggots for heating ovens frequently too the showy arbutus is ravaged by a caterpillar yet more to be dreaded than the woodcutter after this glutton has been at it it could not look more desolate had it been scorched and blackened by fire the moth a pretty little snowwhite bombyx with superb antennary plumes and a cottonwool tippet on her thorax lays her eggs on a leaf of the arbutus and in so doing starts the evil you see a little cushion with pointed ends rather less than an inch in length a white eiderdown tinged with russet thick very soft and formed of hairs fixed with a little gum by the end that points towards the upper extremity of the leaf the eggs are sunk in the thickness of this soft shelter they possess a metallic sheen and look like so many nickel granules hatching takes place in september the first meals are made at the expense of the native leaf the later ones at the expense of the leaves all around one surface only is nibbled usually the upper the other remains intact trellised by the network of veins which are too horny for the newborn grubs the consumption of leaves is effected with scrupulous economy instead of grazing at hazard and using up the pasturage at the dictates of individual caprice the flock progresses gradually from the base to the tip of the leaf with all heads ranged in a frontal attack almost in a straight line not a bite is taken beyond this line until all that lies on this side of it is eaten up as it advances the flock throws a few threads across the denuded portion where nothing remains but the veins and the epidermis of the opposite surface thus is woven a gossamer veil serving as a shelter from the fierce rays of the sun and as the parachute which is essential to these weaklings whom a puff of wind would carry away as the result of a more rapid desiccation on the ravaged surface the leaf soon begins to curl of its own accord curving into a gondola which is covered by a continuous awning stretched from end to end the herbage is then exhausted the flock abandons it and begins again elsewhere in the near neighbourhood after various temporary pastures of this kind in november when the cold weather is at hand the caterpillars settle permanently at the end of a bough nibbled one by one on their upper surfaces the leaves of the terminal bunch draw close to their neighbours which excoriated in their turn do the same until the whole forms a bundle which looks as if it had been scorched lashed together with magnificent white silk this is the winter habitation whence the family still very feeble will not issue until the fine weather returns the assembling of this leafy framework is not due to any special industry on the caterpillars part they do not stretch their threads from leaf to leaf and then by pulling at these ropes bring the various pieces of the structure into contact it is merely the result of desiccation on the nibbled surfaces fixed cables it is true solidly bind together the leaves brought close to one another by the contraction due to their aridity but they do not in any way play the part of a motive mechanism in the work of the assemblage no haulingropes are here no capstans to move the timbers the feeble creatures would be incapable of such effort the thing happens of itself sometimes a floating thread the plaything of the air enlaces some adjacent leaf this chance footbridge tempts the explorers who hasten to strip the accidental prize and without other labour yet one more leaf bends of its own accord and is added to the enclosure for the most part the house is built by eating a lodging is procured by dint of banqueting a comfortable house tightly closed and wellcaulked proof against rain and snow we to guard ourselves against draughts put sandbags against the cracks of our doors and windows the extravagant little arbutus caterpillar applies pipings of silkvelvet to his shutters things should be cosy inside however damp the fog in bad weather the rain drips into my house the leafdwelling knows nothing of such troubles so true is it that animals often enjoy advantages which relegate human industry to the second rank in this shelter of silk and foliage the worst three or four months of the year are passed in a state of complete abstinence no outings not a bite of food in march this torpor ceases and the recluses those starving bellies shift their quarters the community now splits up into squads which spread themselves anyhow over the adjacent verdure this is the period of serious devastation the caterpillars no longer confine themselves to nibbling one surface of the leaf their keen appetites demand the whole of it down to the stalk and now stage by stage halt by halt the arbutus is shorn bare the vagabonds do not return to their winter dwelling which has become too closely cramped they reassemble in groups and weave here there and everywhere shapeless tents temporary huts abandoned for others as the pasturage round about becomes exhausted the denuded boughs to all seeming ravaged by fire take on the look of squalid dryinggrounds hung with rags in june having acquired their full growth the caterpillars leave the arbutustree descend to earth and spin themselves amid the dead leaves a niggardly cocoon in which the insects hairs to some extent supplement its silk a month later the bombyx appears in his final dimensions the caterpillar measures nearly an inch and a quarter in length his costume does not lack richness or originality a black skin with a double row of orange specks on the back long grey hairs arranged in bunches short snowwhite tufts on the sides and a couple of brownvelvet protuberances on the first two rings of the abdomen and also on the last ring but one the most remarkable feature however consists of two tiny craters always open wide two cunningly fashioned goblets which might have been wrought from a drop of red sealingwax the sixth and seventh segments of the abdomen are the only ones that bear these vermilion goblets placed in the middle of the back i do not know the function of these little cups perhaps they should be regarded as organs of information similar to the pine processionarys dorsal mouths the arbutus caterpillar is much dreaded in the village woodcutters faggotbinders brushwoodgatherers all are unanimous in reviling him they have such a painfully vivid memory of the irritation that when i listen to them i can hardly repress a movement of the shoulders to relieve the imaginary itching in the middle of my back i seem to feel the arbutusfaggot laden with its glowing rags rubbing my bare skin it is it appears a disagreeable job to cut down the shrub alive with caterpillars during the hottest part of the day and to shake under the blows of the axe that sort of upastree shedding poison in its shade as for me i have no complaint to make of my relations with the ravager of the arbutus i have very often handled him i have applied his fur to the tips of my fingers my neck and even my face for hours at a time i have ripped up the nests to extract their populations for the purpose of my researches but i have never been inconvenienced save in exceptional circumstances the approach of the moult perhaps this would need a skin less tough than mine the thin skin of a child does not enjoy the same immunity as witness little paul who having helped me to empty some nests and to collect the inhabitants with my forceps was for hours scratching his neck which was dotted with red wheals my ingenuous assistant was proud of his sufferings in the cause of science which resulted from heedlessness and also perhaps from bravado in twentyfour hours the trouble disappeared without leaving any serious consequences all this hardly tallies with the painful experiences of which the woodcutters talk do they exaggerate that is hardly credible they are so unanimous then something must have been lacking in my experiments the propitious moment apparently the proper degree of maturity in the caterpillar the high temperature which aggravates the poison to show itself in its full severity the urtication demands the cooperation of certain undefined circumstances and this cooperation was wanting chance perhaps will one day teach me more than i want to know i shall be attacked in the manner familiar to the woodcutters and shall pass a night in torment tossing and turning as though on a bed of live coals what the direct contact of the caterpillar did not teach me the artifices of chemistry will demonstrate with a violence which i was far from expecting i treat the caterpillar with ether just as i treated the slough of the pine processionary the number of the creatures taken for the infusionthey are pretty small as yet are scarcely half the size which they will attain when matureis about a hundred after a couple of days maceration i filter the liquid and leave it to evaporate freely with the few drops that remain i soak a square of blottingpaper folded in four and apply it to the inner surface of my forearm with a thin rubber sheet and a bandage it is an exact repetition of what i did with the pine processionary applied in the morning the blister hardly takes effect until the following night then by degrees the irritation becomes unendurable and the burning sensation is so acute that i am tormented every moment with the desire to tear off the bandage however i hold out but at the cost of a sleepless feverish night how well i now understand what the woodcutters tell me i had less than a square inch of skin subjected to the torture what would it be if i had my back shoulders neck face and arms tormented in this fashion i pity you with all my heart you labourers who are troubled by the hateful creature on the morrow the infernal paper is removed the skin is red and swollen covered with tiny pimples whence ooze drops of serous fluid for five days the itching persists with a sharp burning pain and the running from the pimples continues then the dead skin dries and comes off in scabs all is over save the redness which is still perceptible a month later the demonstration is accomplished the arbutus caterpillar capable as he is of producing under certain conditions the same effects which i obtain by artificial means fully deserves his odious reputation an insect virus one step forward has been taken but only a very little one as yet in the problem of the stinging caterpillars the drenching with ether teaches us that hairiness plays a very secondary part in the matter with its dust of broken bristles which the least breath wafts in all directions it bothers us by depositing and fixing its irritant coating upon us but this virus does not originate in the creatures fleece it comes from elsewhere what is the source of it i will enter into a few details perhaps in so doing i shall be of service to the novice the subject which is very simple and sharply defined will show us how one question gives rise to another how experimental tests confirm or upset hypotheses which are as it were a temporary scaffolding and lastly how logic that severe examiner leads us by degrees to generalities which are far more important than anything that we were led to anticipate at the outset and first of all does the pine processionary possess a special glandular structure which elaborates the virus as do for instance the poisonglands of the wasps and bees by no means anatomy shows that the internal structure of the stinging caterpillar is similar to that of the harmless one there is nothing more and nothing less the poisonous product of unlocalized origin results therefore from a general process in which the entire organism is brought into play it should in consequence be found in the blood after the manner of urea in higher animals this is a suggestion of grave import but after all quite valueless without the conclusive verdict of actual experiment five or six processionaries pricked with the point of a needle furnish me with a few drops of blood i allow these to soak into a small square of blottingpaper which i then apply to my forearm with a waterproof bandage it is not without a certain anxiety that i await the outcome of the experiment the result will show whether the conclusions already forming in my mind will receive a solid basis or vanish into thin air at a late hour of the night the pain wakes me a pain which this time is an intellectual joy my anticipations were correct the blood does indeed contain the venomous substance it causes itching swelling a burning sensation an exudation of serum and lastly a shedding of the skin i learn more than i had hoped to learn the test is more valuable than that of mere contact with the caterpillar could have been instead of treating myself with the small quantity of poison with which the hairs are smeared i have gone to the source of the irritant substance and i thereby gain an increase of discomfort very happy in my suffering which sets me on a safe path i continue my enquiry by arguing thus the virus in the blood cannot be a living substance one that takes part in the working of the organism it is rather like urea a form of decay an offthrow of the vital process a waste product which is expelled as and when it forms if this be the case i ought to find it in the caterpillars droppings which are made up of both the digestive and the urinary residues let us describe the new experiment which is no less positive than the last i leave a few pinches of very dry droppings such as are found in abundance in the old nests to soak for two days in sulphuric ether the liquid coloured as it is with the chlorophyll of the caterpillars food turns a dirty green then i repeat precisely the process which i mentioned when i wanted to prove the innocuousness of the hairs deprived of their poisonous varnish i refer to it a second time in order thoroughly to explain the method pursued and to save repetition in the various experiments undertaken the infusion is filtered spontaneously evaporated and reduced to a few drops with which i soak my stinger this consists of a small piece of blottingpaper folded in four to increase the thickness of the pad and to give it a greater power of absorption an area of a square inch or less suffices in some cases it is even too much a novice in this kind of researchwork i was too lavish with the liniment and in return for my generosity i had such a bad time that i make a point of warning any reader desirous of repeating the experiment upon his own person fully soaked the square of paper is applied to the forearm on the inner surface where the skin is more tender a sheet of rubber covers it and being waterproof guards against the loss of the poison finally a linen bandage keeps the whole in place on the afternoon of the 4th of june 1897 a memorable date for me i test as i have just said the etheric extract of the processionarys droppings all night long i feel a violent itching a burning sensation and shooting pains on the following day after twenty hours of contact i remove the dressing the venomous liquid too lavishly employed in my fear of failure has considerably overflowed the limits of the square of paper the parts which it has touched and still more the portion covered by the pad are swollen and very red moreover in the latter case the skin is ridged wrinkled and mortified it smarts a little and itches and that is all on the following day the swelling becomes more pronounced and goes deep into the muscles which when touched with the finger throb like an inflamed cheek the colour is a bright carmine and extends all round the spot which the paper covered this is due to the escape of some of the liquid there is a plentiful discharge of serum oozing from the sore in tiny drops the smarting and itching increase and become so intense especially during the night that to get a little sleep i am driven to employ a palliative vaseline with borax and a lint dressing in five days time it has developed into a hideous ulcer which looks more painful than it really is the red swollen flesh quivering and denuded of its epidermis provokes commiseration the person who night and morning renews my dressing of lint and vaseline is almost sick at the sight one would think she says that the dogs had been gnawing your arm i do hope you wont try any more of those horrible decoctions i allow my sympathetic nurse to talk away and am already meditating further experiments some of which will be equally painful o sacred truth what can rival thy power over us mortals thou turnest my petty torment into contentment thou makest me rejoice in my flayed arm what shall i gain by it all i shall know why a wretched caterpillar sets us scratching ourselves nothing more and that is enough for me three weeks later new skin is forming but is covered all over with painful little pimples the swelling diminishes the redness persists and is still very marked the effect of the infernal paper lasts a long time at the end of a month i still feel an itching a burning irritation which is intensified by the warmth of the bedclothes at last a fortnight later all has disappeared but the redness of which i shall retain the marks for a long time yet though it grows gradually fainter and fainter it will take three months or more to vanish altogether we now have some light on the problem the processionarys virus is certainly an offthrow of the organic factory a waste product of the living edifice the caterpillar discards it with his excrement but the material of the droppings has a twofold origin the greater part represents the digestive residuum the rest in a much smaller proportion is composed of the urinary products to which of the two does the virus belong before going farther let us permit ourselves a digression which will assist us in our subsequent enquiries let us ask what advantages the processionary derives from his urticating product i already hear the answer it is a means of protection of defence with his poisoned mane he repels the enemy i do not clearly perceive the bearing of this explanation i think of the creatures recognized enemies of the larva of calosoma sycophanta which lives in the nests of the processionary of the oak and gobbles up the inhabitants with never a thought of their burning fleece of the cuckoo another mighty consumer so we are told of the same caterpillars who gorges on them to the point of implanting in his gizzard a bristling coat of their hairs i am not aware if the processionary of the pine pays a like tribute i do know of at least one of his exploiters this is a dermestes 23 who establishes himself in the silken city and feeds upon the remains of the defunct caterpillars this ghoul assures us of the existence of other consumers all furnished with stomachs expressly fashioned for such highlyseasoned fare for every harvest of living creatures there is always a harvester no the theory of a special virus expressly prepared to defend the processionary and his emulators in urtication is not the last word on the subject i should find it difficult to believe in such a prerogative why have these caterpillars more than others need of protection what reasons would make of them a caste apart endowed with an exceptional defensive venom the part which they play in the entomological world does not differ from that of other caterpillars hairy or smooth it is the naked caterpillars who in default of a mane capable of striking awe into the assailant ought one would think to arm themselves against danger and impregnate themselves with corrosives instead of remaining a meek and easy prey is it likely that the shaggy bristling caterpillar should anoint his fleece with a formidable cosmetic and his smoothcoated kinsman be unfamiliar with the chemical properties of the poison beneath his satin skin these contradictions do not inspire confidence have we not here rather a property common to all caterpillars smoothskinned or hairy among the latter there might be some just a few who under certain special conditions which will need to be defined would be quick to reveal by urtication the venomous nature of their organic refuse the others the vast majority living outside these conditions even though endowed with the necessary product would be inexpert at the stinging business and would not produce irritation by contact in all the same virus is to be found resulting from an identical vital process sometimes it is brought into prominence by the itching which it produces sometimes indeed most often it remains latent unrecognized if our artifices do not intervene what shall these artifices be something very simple i address myself to the silkworm if there be an inoffensive caterpillar in the world it is certainly he women and children take him up by the handful in our silkwormnurseries and their delicate fingers are none the worse for it the satinskinned caterpillar is perfectly innocuous to a skin almost as tender as his own but this lack of caustic venom is only apparent i treat with ether the excretions of the silkworm and the infusion concentrated into a few drops is tested according to the usual method the result is wonderfully definite a smarting sore on the arm similar in its mode of appearance and in its effects to that produced by the droppings of the processionary assures me that logic was right yes the virus which makes one scratch so much which blisters and eats away the skin is not a defensive product vested in only a few caterpillars i recognize it with its invariable properties even in a caterpillar which at first sight appears as though it could not possess anything of the kind the silkworms virus besides is not unknown in my village the casual observation of the peasantwoman has outstripped the precise observation of the man of science the women and girls entrusted with the rearing of the silkwormthe magnanarelles as they are calledcomplain of certain tribulations caused they say by lou verin di magnan the silkworms poison this trouble consists of a violent itching of the eyelids which become red and swollen in the case of the more susceptible there is a rash and the skin peels off the forearm which the turnedup sleeves fail to protect during work i now know the cause of this little trouble my plucky magnanarelles it is not contact with the worm that afflicts you you need have no fear of handling him it is only the litter that you need distrust there jumbled up with the remains of the mulberryleaves is a copious mass of droppings impregnated with the substance which has just so painfully eaten into my skin there and there only is lou verin as you call it it is a relief merely to know the cause of ones trouble but i will provide you with another consolation when you remove the litter and renew the leaves you should raise the irritant dust as little as possible you should avoid lifting your hands to your face above all to your eyes and it is just as well to turn down your sleeves in order to protect your arms if you take these precautions you will suffer no unpleasantness the successful result obtained with the silkworm caused me to foresee a similar success with any caterpillar that i might come across the facts fully confirmed my expectations i tested the stercoral pellets of various caterpillars not selected but just as the hazard of collecting provided them the great tortoiseshell the heath fritillary the large cabbage butterfly the spurge hawkmoth the great peacock moth the deathshead moth the pussmoth the tigermoth and the arbutus liparis all my tests with not a single exception brought about stinging of various degrees of violence it is true i attribute these differences in the result to the greater or lesser quantities of the virus employed for it is impossible to measure the dose so the urticating excretion is common to all the caterpillars by a very unexpected reversion of the usual order of things the popular repugnance is wellfounded prejudice becomes truth all caterpillars are venomous we must draw a distinction however with the same venomous properties some are inoffensive and others far less numerous are to be feared whence comes this difference i note that the caterpillars marked out as stinging live in communities and weave themselves dwellings of silk in which they stay for long periods moreover they are furry of this number are the pine processionary the oak processionary and the caterpillars of various lipares let us consider the firstnamed in particular his nest a voluminous bag spun at the tip of a branch is magnificent in its silky whiteness on the outside inside it is a disgusting cesspit the colony remains in it all day and for the greater part of the night it sallies forth in procession only in the late hours of twilight to browse upon the adjacent foliage this long internment leads to a considerable accumulation of droppings in the heart of the dwelling from all the threads of this labyrinth hang chaplets of these droppings the walls are upholstered with them in all the corridors the little narrow chambers are encumbered with them from a nest the size of a mans head i have obtained with a sieve over threequarters of a pint of stercoral pellets now it is in the midst of this ordure that the caterpillars live and have their being in the midst of it they move swarm and sleep the results of this utter contempt for the rules of cleanliness are obvious certainly the processionary does not soil his coat by contact with those dry pellets he leaves his home with his costume neat and glossy suggesting not a suspicion of uncleanliness no matter by constantly rubbing against the droppings his bristles are inevitably smeared with virus and their barbs poisoned the caterpillar becomes irritant because his manner of life subjects him to prolonged contact with his own ordure now consider the hedgehog caterpillar why is he harmless despite his fierce and hirsute aspect because he lives in isolation and is always on the move his mane apt though it be to collect and retain irritant particles will never give us the itch for the simple reason that the caterpillar does not lie on his excretions distributed all over the fields and far from numerous owing to the caterpillars solitary habits the droppings though poisonous cannot transfer their properties to a fleece which does not come into contact with them if the hedgehog lived in a community in a nest serving as a cesspit he would be the foremost of our stinging caterpillars at first sight the barrackrooms of the silkwormnurseries seem to fulfil the conditions necessary to the surface venom of the worms each change of litter results in the removal of basketfuls of droppings from the trays over this heapedup ordure the silkworms swarm how is it that they do not acquire the poisonous properties of their own excrement i see two reasons in the first place they are hairless and a brushlike coat may well be indispensable to the collection of the virus in the second place far from lying in the filth they live above the soiled stratum being largely separated from it by the bed of leaves which is renewed several times a day despite crowding the population of a tray has nothing that can be compared with the ordinary habits of the processionary and so it remains harmless in spite of its stercoral toxin these first enquiries lead us to conclusions which themselves are very remarkable all caterpillars excrete an urticating matter which is identical throughout the series but if the poison is to manifest itself and to cause us that characteristic itching it is indispensable that the caterpillar shall dwell in a community spending long periods in the nest a silken bag laden with droppings these furnish the virus the caterpillars hairs collect it and transfer it to us the time has come to tackle the problem from another point of view is this formidable matter which always accompanies the excretions a digestive residuum is it not rather one of those waste substances which the organism engenders while at work waste substances designated by the general appellation of urinary products to isolate these products to collect them separately would scarcely be practicable if we did not have recourse to what follows on the metamorphosis every moth on emerging from her chrysalis rejects a copious mixture of uric acid and various humours of which very little is as yet known it may be compared with the broken plaster of a building rebuilt on a new plan and represents the byproducts of the mighty labours accomplished in the transfigured insect these remains are essentially urinary products with no admixture of digested foodstuffs to what insect shall i apply for this residuum chance does many things i collect from the old elmtree in the garden about a hundred curious caterpillars they have seven rows of prickles of an amber yellow a sort of bush with four or five branches i shall learn from the butterfly that they belong to the great tortoiseshell vanessa polychloros lin reared on elmleaves under a wiregauze cover my caterpillars undergo their transformation towards the end of may their chrysalids are specked with brown on a whitish ground and display on the under surface six radiant silvery spots a sort of decorative tinsel like so many mirrors fixed by the tail with a silken pad they hang from the top of the dome swinging at the least movement and emitting vivid flashes of light from their reflectors my children are amazed at this living chandelier it is a treat for them when i allow them to come and admire it in my animal studio another surprise awaits them this time a tragic one however a fortnight later the butterflies emerge i have placed under the cover a large sheet of white paper which will receive the desired products i call the children what do they see on the paper large spots of blood under their very eyes from up there at the top of the dome a butterfly lets fall a great red drop plop no joy for the children today anxiety rather almost fear i send them away saying to them be sure and remember kiddies what you have just seen and if ever any one talks to you about showers of blood dont be silly and frightened a pretty butterfly is the cause of those bloodred stains which have been known to terrify countryfolk the moment she is born she casts out in the form of a red liquid the remains of her old caterpillar body a body remodelled and reborn in a beautiful shape that is the whole secret when my artless visitors have departed i resume my examination of the rain of blood falling under the cover still clinging to the shell of its chrysalis each tortoiseshell ejects and sheds upon the paper a great red drop which if left standing deposits a powdery pink sediment composed of urates the liquid is now a deep crimson when the whole thing is perfectly dry i cut out of the spotted paper some of the richer stains and steep the bits in ether the spots on the paper remain as red as at the outset and the liquid assumes a light lemon tint when reduced by evaporation to a few drops this liquid provides me with what i require to soak my square of blottingpaper what shall i say to avoid repeating myself the effects of the new caustic are precisely the same as those which i experienced when i used the droppings of the processionary the same itching the same burning the same swelling with the flesh throbbing and inflamed the same serous exudation the same peeling of the skin the same persistent redness which lingers for three or four months long after the ulceration itself has disappeared without being very painful the sore is so irksome and above all looks so ugly that i swear never to let myself in for it again henceforth without waiting for the thing to eat into my flesh i shall remove the caterpillar plaster as soon as i feel a conclusive itching in the course of these painful experiences friends upbraid me with not having recourse to the assistance of some animal such as the guineapig that stock victim of the physiologists i take no note of their reproaches the animal is a stoic it says nothing of its sufferings if the torture being a little too intense it complains i am in no position to interpret its cries exactly or to attribute them to a definite impression the guineapig will not say it smarts it itches it burns he will simply say that hurts as i want to know the details of the sensations experienced the best thing is to resort to my own skin the only witness on whose evidence i can rely implicitly at the risk of provoking a smile i will venture on another confession as i begin to see into the matter more clearly i hesitate to torture or destroy a single creature in gods great community the life of the least of these is a thing to be respected we can take it away but we cannot give it peace to those innocents so little interested in our investigations what does our restless curiosity matter to their calm and sacred ignorance if we wish to know let us pay the price ourselves as far as possible the acquisition of an idea is well worth the sacrifice of a bit of skin the elm tortoiseshell with her rain of blood may leave us to a certain extent in doubt might not this strange red substance with its unusual appearance contain a poison which is likewise exceptional i address myself therefore to the mulberry bombyx to the pine bombyx and to the great peacock i collect the uric excretions ejected by the newly hatched moths this time the liquid is whitish sullied here and there with uncertain tints there is no bloodred colouration but the result is the same the virulent energy manifests itself in the most definite manner therefore the processionarys virus exists equally in all caterpillars in all butterflies and moths emerging from the chrysalis and this virus is a byproduct of the organism a urinary product the curiosity of our minds is insatiable the moment a reply is obtained a fresh question arises why should the lepidoptera alone be endowed in this manner the organic labours accomplished within them cannot differ greatly as to the nature of the materials from those presiding over the maintenance of life in other insects therefore these others also elaborate a byproduct which has stinging powers this can be verifiedand that forthwithwith the elements at my disposal the first reply is furnished by cetonia floricola of which beetle i collect half a dozen chrysalids from a heap of leaves halfconverted into mould a box receives my find laid on a sheet of white paper on which the urinary fluid of the perfect insect will fall as soon as the caskets are broken the weather is favourable and i have not long to wait the thing is done the matter rejected is white the usual colour of these residua in the great majority of insects at the moment of the metamorphosis though by no means abundant it nevertheless provokes on my forearm a violent itching together with mortification of the skin which comes off in flakes the reason why it does not display a more distinct sore is that i judged it prudent to end the experiment the burning and itching tell me enough as to the results of a contact unduly prolonged now to the hymenoptera i have not in my possession i regret to say any of those with whom my rearingchambers used formerly to provide me whether honeybee or hunting wasps i have only a green sawfly whose larva lives in numerous families on the leaves of the alder reared under cover this larva provides me with enough tiny black droppings to fill a thimble that is sufficient the urtication is quite definite i take next the insects with incomplete transformations my recent rearings have given me quite a collection of excretions emanating from the orthoptera i consult those of the vine ephippiger 24 and the great grey locust both sting to a degree which once more makes me regret my lavish hand we will be satisfied with this indeed my arms demand as much for tattooed with red squares they refuse to make room for fresh brandings the examples are sufficiently varied to impose the following conclusion the processionarys virus is found in a host of other insects apparently even in the entire series it is a urinary product inherent in the entomological organism the dejections of insects especially those evacuated at the end of the metamorphosis contain or are even almost entirely composed of urates can the stinging material be the inevitable associate of uric acid it should then form part of the excrement of the bird and the reptile which in both cases is very rich in urates here again is a suspicion worthy of verification by experiment for the moment it is impossible for me to question the reptile it is easy on the other hand to interrogate the bird whose reply will suffice i accept what is offered by chance an insectivorous bird the swallow and a graminivorous bird the goldfinch well their urinary dejections when carefully separated from the digestive residua have not the slightest stinging effect the virus that causes itching is independent therefore of uric acid it accompanies it in the insect class without being its invariable concomitant every elsewhere a last step remains for us to take namely to isolate the stinging element and to obtain it in quantities permitting of precise enquiries into its nature and properties it seems to me that medical science might turn to account a material whose energy rivals that of cantharides if it does not exceed it the question appeals to me i would gladly return to my beloved chemistry but i should want reagents apparatus a laboratory a whole costly arsenal of which i must not dream afflicted as i am with a terrible ailment impecuniosity the searchers habitual lot the psyches the laying in the springtime old walls and dusty roads harbour a surprise for whoso has eyes to see tiny faggots for no apparent reason set themselves in motion and make their way along by sudden jerks the inanimate comes to life the immovable stirs how does this come about look closer and the motive power will stand revealed enclosed within the moving bundle is a fairly welldeveloped caterpillar prettily striped in black and white seeking for food or perhaps for a spot where the transformation can be effected he hurries along timidly attired in a queer rigout of twigs from which nothing emerges except the head and the front part of the body which is furnished with six short legs at the least alarm he goes right in and does not budge again this is the whole secret of the little roaming bundle of sticks the faggot caterpillar belongs to the psyche group whose name conveys an allusion to the classic psyche symbolical of the soul we must not allow this phrase to carry our thoughts to loftier heights than is fitting the nomenclator with his rather circumscribed view of the world did not trouble about the soul when inventing his descriptive label he simply wanted a pretty name and certainly he could have hit on nothing better to protect himself from the weather our chilly bareskinned psyche builds himself a portable shelter a travelling cottage which the owner never leaves until he becomes a moth it is something better than a hut on wheels with a thatched roof to it it is a hermits frock made of an unusual sort of frieze in the valley of the danube the peasant wears a goatskin cloak fastened with a belt of rushes the psyche dons an even more rustic apparel he makes himself a suit of clothes out of hoppoles it is true that beneath this rude conglomeration which would be a regular hairshirt to a skin as delicate as his he puts a thick lining of silk the clythra beetle garbs himself in pottery this one dresses himself in a faggot in april on the walls of my chief observatory that famous pebbly acre with its wealth of insect life i find the psyche who is to furnish me with my most circumstantial and detailed records 25 he is at this period in the torpor of the approaching metamorphosis as we can ask him nothing else for the moment let us look into the construction and composition of his faggot it is a not irregular structure spindleshaped and about an inch and a half long the pieces that compose it are fixed in front and free at the back are arranged anyhow and would form a rather ineffective shelter against the sun and rain if the recluse had no other protection than his thatched roof the word thatch is suggested to my mind by a summary inspection of what i see but it is not an exact expression in this case on the contrary graminaceous straws are rare to the great advantage of the future family which as we shall learn presently would find nothing to suit them in jointed planks what predominates is remnants of very small stalks light soft and rich in pith such as are possessed by various chicoriaceæ i recognize in particular the floral stems of the mouseear hawkweed and the nimes pterotheca next come bits of grassleaves scaly twigs provided by the cypresstree and all sorts of little sticks coarse materials adopted for the lack of anything better lastly if the favourite cylindrical pieces fall short the mantle is sometimes finished off with an ample flounced tippet that is to say with fragments of dry leaves of any kind incomplete as it is this list shows us that the caterpillar apart from his preference for pithy morsels has no very exclusive tastes he employs indifferently anything that he comes upon provided that it be light very dry softened by long exposure to the air and of suitable dimensions all his finds if they come anywhere near his estimates are used just as they are without any alterations or sawing to reduce them to the proper length the psyche does not trim the laths that go to form his roof he gathers them as he finds them his work is limited to imbricating them one after the other by fixing them at the foreend in order to lend itself to the movements of the journeying caterpillar and in particular to facilitate the action of the head and legs when a new piece is to be placed in position the front part of the sheath requires a special structure here a casing of beams is no longer allowable for their length and stiffness would hamper the artisan and even make his work impossible what is essential here is a flexible neck able to bend in all directions the assemblage of stakes does in fact end suddenly at some distance from the forepart and is there replaced by a collar in which the silken woof is merely hardened with very tiny ligneous particles tending to strengthen the material without impairing its flexibility this collar which gives free movement is so important that all the psyches make equal use of it however much the rest of the work may differ all carry in front of the faggot of sticks a yielding neck soft to the touch formed inside of a web of pure silk and velveted outside with a fine sawdust which the caterpillar obtains by crushing with his mandibles any sort of dry straw a similar velvet but lustreless and faded apparently through age finishes the sheath at the back in the form of a rather long bare appendix open at the end let us now remove the outside of the straw envelope shredding it piecemeal the demolition gives us a varying number of joists i have counted as many as eighty and more the ruin that remains is a cylindrical sheath wherein we discover from one end to the other the structure which we perceived at the front and rear the two parts which are naturally bare the tissue everywhere is of very stout silk which resists without breaking when pulled by the fingers a smooth tissue beautifully white inside drab and wrinkled outside where it bristles with encrusted woody particles there will be an opportunity later to discover by what means the caterpillar makes himself so complicated a garment in which are laid one upon the other in a definite order first the extremely fine satin which is in direct contact with the skin next the mixed stuff a sort of frieze dusted with ligneous matter which saves the silk and gives consistency to the work lastly the surtout of overlapping laths while retaining this general threefold arrangement the scabbard offers notable variations of structural detail in the different species here for instance is a second psyche 26 the most belated of the three which i have chanced to come upon i meet him towards the end of june hurrying across some dusty path near the houses his cases surpass those of the previous species both in size and in regularity of arrangement they form a thick coverlet of many pieces in which i recognize here fragments of hollow stalks there bits of fine straw with perhaps straps formed of blades of grass in front there is never any mantilla of dead leaves a troublesome piece of finery which without being in regular use is pretty frequent in the costume of the firstnamed species at the back no long denuded vestibule save for the indispensable collar at the aperture all the rest is cased in logs there is not much variety about the thing but when all is said there is a certain elegance in its stern faultlessness the smallest in size and simplest in dress is the third 27 who is very common at the end of winter on the walls as well as in the furrows of the barks of gnarled old trees be they olivetrees holmoaks elms or almost any other his case a modest little bundle is hardly more than twofifths of an inch in length a dozen rotten straws gleaned at random and fixed close to one another in a parallel direction represent with the silk sheath his whole outlay on dress it would be difficult to clothe ones self more economically this pigmy apparently so uninteresting shall supply us with our first records of the curious lifestory of the psyches i gather him in profusion in april and instal him in a wire belljar what he eats i know not my ignorance would be grievous under other conditions but at present i need not trouble about provisions taken from their walls and trees where they had suspended themselves for their transformation most of my little psyches are in the chrysalis state a few of them are still active they hasten to clamber to the top of the trelliswork they fix themselves there perpendicularly by means of a little silk cushion then everything is still june comes to an end and the male moths are hatched leaving the chrysalid wrapper half caught in the case which remains fixed where it is and will remain there indefinitely until dismantled by the weather the emergence is effected through the hinder end of the bundle of sticks the only way by which it can be effected having permanently closed the top opening the real door of the house by fastening it to the support which he has chosen the caterpillar therefore has turned the other way round and undergone his transformation in a reversed position which enables the adult insect to emerge through the outlet made at the back the only one now free for that matter this is the method followed by all the psyches the case has two apertures the front one which is more regular and more carefully constructed is at the caterpillars service so long as larval activity lasts it is closed and firmly fastened to its support at the time of the nymphosis the hinder one which is faulty and even hidden by the sagging of the sides is at the moths service it does not really open until right at the end when pushed by the chrysalis or the adult insect in their modest pearlgrey dress with their insignificant wingequipment hardly exceeding that of a common fly our little moths are still not without elegance they have handsome feathery plumes for antennæ their wings are edged with delicate fringes they whirl very fussily inside the belljar they skim the ground fluttering their wings they crowd eagerly around certain sheaths which nothing on the outside distinguishes from the others they alight upon them and sound them with their plumes this feverish agitation marks them as lovers in search of their brides this one here that one there each of them finds his mate but the coy one does not leave her home things happen very discreetly through the wicket left open at the free end of the case the male stands on the threshold of this backdoor for a little while and then it is over the wedding is finished there is no need for us to linger over these nuptials in which the parties concerned do not know do not see each other i hasten to place in a glass tube the few cases in which the mysterious events have happened some days later the recluse comes out of the sheath and shows herself in all her wretchedness call that little fright a moth one cannot easily get used to the idea of such poverty the caterpillar of the start was no humblerlooking there are no wings none at all no silky fur either at the tip of the abdomen a round tufty pad a crown of dirtywhite velvet on each segment in the middle of the back a large rectangular dark patch these are the sole attempts at ornament the mother psyche renounces all the beauty which her name of moth promised from the centre of the hairy coronet a long ovipositor stands out consisting of two parts one stiff forming the base of the implement the other soft and flexible sheathed in the first just as a telescope fits in its tube the laying mother bends herself into a hook grips the lower end of her case with her six feet and drives her probe into the backwindow a window which serves manifold purposes allowing of the consummation of the clandestine marriage the emergence of the fertilized bride the installation of the eggs and lastly the exodus of the young family there at the free end of her case the mother remains for a long time bowed and motionless what can she be doing in this contemplative attitude she is lodging her eggs in the house which she has just left she is bequeathing the maternal cottage to her heirs some thirty hours pass and the ovipositor is at last withdrawn the laying is finished a little wadding supplied by the coronet on the hindquarters closes the door and allays the dangers of invasion the fond mother makes a barricade for her brood of the sole ornament which in her extreme indigence she possesses better still she makes a rampart of her body bracing herself convulsively on the threshold of her home she dies there dries up there devoted to her family even after death it needs an accident a breath of air to make her fall from her post let us now open the case it contains the chrysalid wrapper intact except for the front breach through which the psyche emerged the male because of his wings and his plumes very cumbersome articles when he is about to make his way through the narrow pass takes advantage of his chrysalis state to make a start for the door and come out halfway then bursting his amber tunic the delicate moth finds an open space where flight is possible right in front of him the mother unprovided with wings and plumes is not compelled to observe any such precautions her cylindrical form bare and differing but little from that of the caterpillar allows her to crawl to slip into the narrow passage and to come forth without obstacle her cast chrysalid skin is therefore left right at the back of the case well covered by the thatched roof and this is an act of prudence marked by exquisite tenderness the eggs in fact are packed in the barrel in the parchmentlike wallet formed by the slough the mother has thrust her telescopic ovipositor to the bottom of that receptacle and has methodically gone on laying until it is full not satisfied with bequeathing her home and her velvet coronet to her offspring as a last sacrifice she leaves them her skin with a view to observing at my ease the events which are soon to happen i extract one of these chrysalid bags stuffed with eggs from its faggot and place it by itself beside its case in a glass tube i have not long to wait in the first week of july i find myself all of a sudden in possession of a large family the quickness of the hatching balked my watchfulness the newborn caterpillars about forty in number have already had time to garb themselves they wear a persian headdress a mages tiara in dazzling white plush or to abandon highflown language let us say a cotton nightcap without a tassel only the cap does not stand up from the head it covers the hindquarters great animation reigns in the tube which is a spacious residence for such vermin they roam about gaily with their caps sticking up almost perpendicular to the floor with a tiara like that and things to eat life must be sweet indeed but what do they eat i try a little of everything that grows on the bare stone and the gnarled old trees nothing is welcomed more eager to dress than to feed themselves the psyches scorn what i set before them my ignorance as an insectbreeder will not matter provided that i succeed in seeing with what materials and in what manner the first outlines of the cap are woven i may fairly hope to achieve this ambition as the chrysalid bag is far from having exhausted its contents i find in it teeming amid the rumpled wrapper of the eggs an additional family as numerous as the swarm that is already out the total laying must therefore amount to five or six dozen i transfer to another receptacle the precocious band which is already dressed and keep only the naked laggards in the tube they have bright red heads with the rest of their bodies dirty white and they measure hardly a twentyfifth of an inch in length my patience is not long put to the test next day little by little singly or in groups the belated grubs quit the chrysalid bag they come out without breaking the frail wallet through the front breach made by the liberation of the mother not one of them utilizes it as a dressmaterial though it has the delicacy and amber colouring of an onionskin nor do any of them make use of a fine quilting which lines the inside of the bag and forms an exquisitely soft bed for the eggs this down whose origin we shall have to investigate presently ought one would say to make an excellent blanket for these chilly ones impatient to cover themselves up not a single one uses it there would not be enough to go round all go straight to the coarse faggot which i left in contact with the wallet that was the chrysalis time presses before making your entrance into the world and going agrazing you must first be clad all therefore with equal fury attack the old sheath and hastily dress themselves in the mothers cast clothes some turn their attention to bits that happen to be open lengthwise and scrape the soft white inner layer others greatly daring penetrate into the tunnel of a hollow stalk and go and collect their cotton goods in the dark at such times the materials are firstclass and the garment woven is of a dazzling white others bite deep into the piece which they select and make themselves a motley garment in which darkcoloured particles mar the snowy whiteness of the rest the tool which they use for their gleaning consists of the mandibles shaped like wide shears with five strong teeth apiece the two planes fit into each other and form an implement capable of seizing and slicing any fibre however small seen under the microscope it is a wonderful specimen of mechanical precision and power were the sheep similarly equipped in proportion to her size she would browse upon the bottom of the trees instead of cropping the grass a very instructive workshop is that of the psychevermin toiling to make themselves a cotton nightcap there are numbers of things to remark in both the finish of the work and the ingenuity of the methods employed to avoid repeating ourselves we will say nothing about these yet but wait for a little and return to the subject when setting forth the talents of a second psyche of larger stature and easier to observe the two weavers observe exactly the same procedure nevertheless let us take a glance at the bottom of the eggcup a general workyard in which i instal my dwarfs as the cases turn them out there are some hundreds of them with the sheaths from which they came and an assortment of clipped stalks chosen from among the driest and richest in pith what a whirl what bewildering animation in order to see man micromégas cut himself a lens out of a diamond of his necklace he held his breath lest the storm from his nostrils should blow the mite away i in my turn will be the good giant newly arriving from sirius i screw a magnifyingglass into my eye and am careful not to breathe for fear of overturning and sweeping out of existence my cottonworkers if i need one of them to focus him under a stronger glass i lime him as it were seizing him with the fine point of a needle which i have passed over my lips taken away from his work the tiny caterpillar struggles at the end of the needle shrivels up makes himself small as he is still smaller he strives to withdraw as far as possible into his clothing which as yet is incomplete the merest flannel vest or even a narrow scarf covering nothing but the top of his shoulders let us leave him to complete his coat i give a puff and the creature is swallowed up in the crater of the eggcup and this speck is alive it is industrious it is versed in the art of blanketmaking an orphan born that moment it knows how to cut itself out of its dead mothers old clothes the wherewithal to clothe itself in its turn soon it will become a carpenter an assembler of timber to make a defensive covering for its delicate fabric what must instinct be to be capable of awakening such industries in an atom it is at the end of june also that i obtain in his adult shape the psyche whose scabbard is continued underneath by a long naked vestibule most of the cases are fastened by a silk pad to the trelliswork of the cage and hang vertically like stalactites some few of them have never left the ground half immersed in the sand they stand erect with their rear in the air and their forepart buried and firmly anchored to the side of the pan by means of a silky paste this inverted position excludes any idea of weight as a guide in the caterpillars preparations an adept at turning round in his cabin he is careful before he sinks into the immobility of pupadom to turn his head now upwards now downwards towards the opening so that the adult insect which is much less free than the larva in its movements may reach the outside without obstacle moreover it is the pupa itself the unbending chrysalis incapable of turning and obliged to move all in one piece which stubbornly crawling carries the male to the threshold of the case it emerges half way at the end of the uncovered silky vestibule and there breaks obstructing the opening with its slough as it does so for a time the moth stands still on the roof of the cottage allowing his humours to evaporate his wings to spread and gather strength then at last the gallant takes flight in search of her for whose sake he has made himself so spruce he wears a costume of deepest black all except the edges of the wings which having no scales remain diaphanous his antennæ likewise black are wide and graceful plumes were they on a larger scale they would throw the feathered beauty of the marabou and ostrich into the shade the bravely beplumed one visits case after case in his tortuous flight prying into the secrets of those alcoves if things go as he wishes he settles with a quick flutter of his wings on the extremity of the denuded vestibule comes the wedding as discreet as that of the smaller psyche here is yet another who does not see or at most catches a fleeting glimpse of her for whose sake he has donned maraboufeathers and a blackvelvet cloak the recluse on her side is equally impatient the lovers are shortlived they die in my cages within three or four days so that for long intervals until the hatching of some latecomer the female population is short of suitors so when the morning sun already hot strikes the cage a very singular spectacle is repeated many times before my eyes the entrance to the vestibule swells imperceptibly opens and emits a mass of infinitely delicate down a spiders web carded and made into wadding would give nothing of such gossamer fineness it is a vaporous cloud then from out of this incomparable eiderdown appear the head and forepart of a very different sort of caterpillar from the original collector of straws it is the mistress of the house the marriageable moth who feeling her hour about to come and failing to receive the expected visit herself makes the advances and goes as far as she can to meet her plumed swain he does not come hastening up and for good reason there is not a male left in the establishment for two or three hours the poor forsaken one leans without moving from her window then tired of waiting very gently she goes indoors again backwards and returns to her cell next day the day after and later still as long as her strength permits she reappears on her balcony always in the morning in the soft rays of a warm sun and always on a sofa of that incomparable down which disperses and turns to vapour if i merely fan it with my hand again no one comes for the last time the disappointed moth goes back to her boudoir never to leave it again she dies in it dries up a useless thing i hold my belljars responsible for this crime against motherhood in the open fields without a doubt sooner or later wooers would have appeared coming from the four winds the said belljars have an even more pitiful catastrophe on their conscience sometimes leaning too far from her window miscalculating the balance between the front of the body which is at liberty and the back which remains sheathed in its case the moth allows herself to drop to the ground it is all up now with the fallen one and her lineage still there is one good thing about it accidents such as this lay bare the mother psyche without our having to break into her house what a miserable creature she is a great deal uglier than the original caterpillar here transfiguration spells disfigurement progress means retrogression what we have before our eyes is a wrinkled satchel an earthyyellow sausage and this horror worse than a maggot is a moth in the full bloom of life a genuine adult moth she is the betrothed of the elegant black bombyx all plumed with maraboufeathers and represents to him the last word in beauty as the proverb says beauty lies in lovers eyes a profound truth which the psyche confirms in striking fashion let us describe the ugly little sausage a very small head a paltry globule disappearing almost entirely in the folds of the first segment what need is there of cranium and brains for a germbag and so the tiny creature almost does without them reduces them to the simplest expression nevertheless there are two black ocular specks do these vestigial eyes see their way about not very clearly we may be sure the pleasures of light must be very small for this stayathome who appears at her window only on rare occasions when the male moth is late in arriving the legs are wellshaped but so short and weak that they are of no use at all for locomotion the whole body is a pale yellow semitransparent in front opaque and stuffed with eggs behind underneath the first segments is a sort of neckband that is to say a dark stain the vestige of a crop showing through the skin a pad of short down ends the oviferous part at the back it is all that remains of a fleece of a thin velvet which the insect rubs off as it moves backwards and forwards in its narrow lodging this forms the flaky mass which whitens the trystingwindow at the weddingtime and also lines the inside of the sheath with down in short the creature is little more than a bag swollen with eggs for the best part of its length i know nothing lower in the scale of wretchedness the germbag moves but not of course with those vestiges of legs which form too short and feeble supports it gets about in a way that allows it to progress on its back belly or side indifferently a groove is hollowed out at the hinder end of the bag a deep dividing groove which cuts the insect into two it runs to the front part spreading like a wave and gently and slowly reaches the head this undulation constitutes a step when it is done the animal has advanced about a twentyfifth part of an inch to go from one end to the other of a box two inches long and filled with fine sand the living sausage takes nearly an hour it is by crawling like this that it moves about in its case when it comes to the threshold to meet its visitor and goes in again for three or four days exposed to the roughness of the soil the oviferous bag leads a wretched life creeping about at random or more often standing still no moth pays attention to the poor thing who possesses no attractions outside her home the lovers pass by with an indifferent air this coolness is logical enough why should she become a mother if her family is to be abandoned to the inclemencies of the public way and so after falling by accident from her case which would have been the cradle of the youngsters the wanderer withers in a few days and dies childless the fertilized onesand these are the more numerousthe prudent ones who have saved themselves from a fall by being less lavish with their appearances at the window reenter the sheath and do not show themselves again once the moths visit to the threshold is over let us wait a fortnight and then open the case lengthwise with our scissors at the end in the widest part opposite the vestibule is the slough of the chrysalis a long fragile ambercoloured sack open at the end that contains the head the end facing the exitpassage in this sack which she fills like a mould lies the mother the eggbladder now giving no sign of life from this amber sheath which presents all the usual characteristics of a chrysalis the adult psyche emerged in the guise of a shapeless moth looking like a big maggot at the present time she has slipped back into her old jacket moulding herself into it in such a way that it becomes difficult to separate the container from the contents one would take the whole thing for a single body it seems very likely that this cast skin which occupies the best place in the home formed the psyches refuge when weary of waiting on the threshold of her hall she retired to the back room she has therefore gone in and out repeatedly this constant going and coming this continual rubbing against the sides of a narrow corridor just wide enough for her to pass through ended by stripping her of her down she had a fleece to start with a very light and scanty fleece it is true but still a vestige of the costume which moths are wont to wear this fluff she has lost what has she done with it the eider robs herself of her down to make a luxurious bed for her brood the newborn rabbits lie on a mattress which their mother cards for them with the softest part of her fur shorn from the belly and neck wherever the shears of her front teeth can reach it this fond tenderness is shared by the psyche as you will see in front of the chrysalid bag is an abundant mass of extrafine wadding similar to that of which a few flocks used to fall outside on the occasions when the recluse went to her window is it silk is it spun muslin no but it is something of incomparable delicacy the microscope recognizes it as the scaly dust the impalpable down in which every moth is clad to give a snug shelter to the little caterpillars who will soon be swarming in the case to provide them with a refuge in which they can play about and gather strength before entering the wide world the psyche has stripped herself of her fur like the mother rabbit this denudation may be a mere mechanical result an unintentional effect of repeated rubbing against the lowroofed walls but there is nothing to tell us so maternity has its foresight even among the humblest i therefore picture the hairy moth twisting about going to and fro in the narrow passage in order to get rid of the fleece and prepare bedding for her offspring it is even possible that she manages to use her lips that vestige of a mouth in order to pull out the down that refuses to come away of itself no matter what the method of shearing may be a mound of scales and hairs fills up the case in front of the chrysalid bag for the moment it is a barricade preventing access to the house which is open at the hinder end soon it will be a downy couch on which the little caterpillars will rest for a while after leaving the egg here warmly ensconced in a rug of extreme softness they call a halt as a preparation for the emergence and the work that follows it not that silk is lacking on the contrary it abounds the caterpillar lavished it during his time as a spinner and a pickerup of straws the whole interior of the case is padded with thick white satin but how greatly preferable to this toocompact and luxurious upholstery is the delightful eiderdown bedding of the newborn youngsters we know the preparations made for the coming family now where are the eggs at what spot are they laid the smallest of my three psyches who is less misshapen than the others and freer in her movements leaves her case altogether she possesses a long ovipositor and inserts it through the exithole right into the chrysalid slough which is left where it was in the form of a bag this slough receives the laying when the operation is finished and the bag of eggs is full the mother dies outside hanging on to the case the two other psyches who do not carry telescopic ovipositors and whose only method of changing their position is a dubious sort of crawling have more singular customs to show us one might quote with regard to them what used to be said of the roman matrons those model mothers domi mansit lanam fecit yes lanam fecit the psyche does not really work the wool on the distaff but at least she bequeathes to her sons her own fleece converted into a heap of wadding yes domi mansit she never leaves her house not even for her wedding not even for the purpose of laying her eggs we have seen how after receiving the visit of the male the shapeless moth that uncouth sausage retreats to the back of her case and withdraws into her chrysalid slough which she fills exactly just as though she had never left it the eggs are in their place then and there they occupy the regulation sack favoured by the various psyches of what use would a laying be now strictly speaking there is none in fact that is to say the eggs do not leave the mothers womb the living pouch which has engendered them keeps them within itself soon this bag loses its moisture by evaporation it dries up and at the same time remains sticking to the chrysalid wrapper that firm support let us open the thing what does the magnifyingglass show us a few trachean threads lean bundles of muscles nervous ramifications in short the relics of a form of vitality reduced to its simplest expression taken all around very nearly nothing the rest of the contents is a mass of eggs an agglomeration of germs numbering close upon three hundred in a word the insect is one enormous ovary assisted by just so much as enables it to perform its functions the psyches the cases the hatching of the eggs takes place in the first fortnight of july the little grubs measure about one twentyfifth of an inch their head and the upper part of the first thoracic segment are a glossy black the next two segments brownish and the rest of the body a pale amber sharp lively little creatures who run about with short quick steps they swarm all over the spongy hairy tissue resulting from the castoff clothing of the eggs the books tell me that the little psyches begin by eating up their mother a loathsome banquet for which the said books must accept responsibility i see nothing of the sort and i do not even understand how the idea arose the mother bequeaths to her sons her case whose straws are searched for wadding the material of the first coat out of her chrysalid slough and her skin she makes them a twofold shelter for the hatchingtime with her down she prepares a defensive barricade for them and a place wherein to wait before emerging thus all is given all spent with a view to the future save for some thin dry strips which my lens can only with difficulty distinguish there is nothing left that could provide a cannibal feast for so numerous a family no my little psyches you do not eat your mother in vain do i watch you never either to clothe or to feed himself does any one of you lay a tooth upon the remains of the deceased the maternal skin is left untouched as are those other insignificant relics the layer of muscular tissue and the network of airducts the sack left behind by the chrysalis also remains intact the time comes to quit the natal wallet an outlet has been contrived long beforehand saving the youngsters from committing any act of violence against what was once their mother there is no sacrilegious cutting to be done with the shears the door opens of itself when she was a wriggling speck of sausage the mothers front segments were remarkably translucent forming a contrast with the rest of the body this was very probably a sign of a less dense and less tough texture than elsewhere the sign is not misleading the dry gourd to which the mother is now reduced has for a neck those diaphanous rings which as they withered became extremely fragile does this neck this operculum fall of its own accord or is it pushed off by the pigmies impatient to get away i do not know for certain this however i can say that blowing on it is enough to make it drop off in anticipation therefore of the emergence an exceedingly easy and perhaps even spontaneous method of decapitation is prepared in the mothers lifetime to manufacture a delicate neck for yourself so that you may be easily beheaded at the proper time and thus leave the way free to the youngsters is an act of devotion in which the most unconscious maternal affection stands sublimely revealed that miserable maggot that sausage moth scarce able to crawl and yet so clearsighted where the future is concerned staggers the mind of any one who knows how to think the brood emerge from the natal wallet through the window just opened by the fall of the head the chrysalid sack the second wrapper presents no obstacle it has remained open since the adult psyche left it next comes the mass of eiderdown the heap of fluff of which the mother stripped herself here the little caterpillars stop much more spaciously and comfortably lodged than in the bag whence they have come some take a rest others bustle about exercise themselves in walking all pick up strength in preparation for their exodus into the daylight they do not stay long amid this luxury gradually as they gain vigour they come out and spread over the surface of the case work begins at once a very urgent work that of the wardrobe the first mouthfuls will come afterwards when we are dressed montaigne when putting on the cloak which his father had worn before him used a touching expression he said i dress myself in my father the young psyches in the same way dress themselves in their mother they cover themselves with the clothes left behind by the deceased they scrape from it the wherewithal to make themselves a cotton frock the material employed is the pith of the little stalks especially of the pieces which split lengthwise are more easily stripped of their contents the grub first finds a spot to suit it having done so it gleans it planes with its mandibles thus a superbly white wadding is extracted from old logs the manner of beginning the garment is worth noting the tiny creature employs as judicious a method as any which our own industry could hope to discover the wadding is collected in infinitesimal pellets how are these little particles to be fixed as and when they are detached by the shears of the mandibles the manufacturer needs a support a base and this support cannot be obtained on the caterpillars own body for any adherence would be seriously embarrassing and would hamper freedom of movement the difficulty is overcome very cleverly scraps of plush are gathered and by degrees fastened to one another with threads of silk this forms a sort of rectilinear garland in which the particles collected swing from a common rope when these preparations are deemed sufficient the little creature passes the garland round its waist at about the third segment of the thorax so as to leave its six legs free then it ties the two ends with a bit of silk the result is a girdle generally incomplete but soon completed with other scraps fastened to the silk ribbon that carries everything this girdle is the base of the work the support henceforth to lengthen the piece to enlarge it into the perfect garment the grub has only to fix always at the foreedge with the aid of its spinnerets now at the top now at the bottom or side the scraps of pith which the mandibles never cease extracting nothing could be better thought out than this initial garland laid out flat and then buckled like a belt around the loins once this base is laid the weavingloom is in full swing the piece woven is first a tiny string around the waist next by the addition of fresh pellets always at the foreedge it grows into a scarf a waistcoat a short jacket and lastly a sack which gradually makes its way backwards not of itself but through the action of the weaver who slips forward in the part of the case already made in a few hours the garment is completed it is by that time a conical hood a cloak of magnificent whiteness and finish we now know all about it on leaving the maternal hut without searching without distant expeditions which would be so dangerous at that age the little psyche finds in the tender beams of the roof the wherewithal to clothe himself he is spared the perils of roaming in a state of nudity when he leaves the house he will be quite warm thanks to the mother who takes care to instal her family in the old case and gives it choice materials to work with if the grubworm were to drop out of the hovel if some gust of wind swept him to a distance most often the poor mite would be lost ligneous straws rich in pith dry and retted to a turn are not to be found everywhere it would mean the impossibility of any clothing and in that dire poverty an early death but if suitable materials are encountered equal in quality to those bequeathed by the mother how is it that the exile is unable to make use of them let us look into this i segregate a few newborn grubs in a glass tube and give them for their materials some split pieces of straw picked from among the old stalks of a sort of dandelion pterotheca nemausensis though robbed of the inheritance of the maternal manor the grubs seem very well satisfied with my bits without the least hesitation they scrape out of them a superb white pith and make it into a delicious cloak much handsomer than that which they would have obtained with the ruins of the native house this latter cloak being always more or less flawed with darker materials whose colour has been impaired by long exposure to the air on the other hand the nîmes dandelion a relic of last spring has its central part which i myself lay bare a spotless white and the cotton nightcap achieves the very perfection of whiteness i obtain an even better result with rounds of sorghumpith taken from the kitchenbroom this time the work has glittering crystalline points and looks like a thing built of grains of sugar it is my manufacturers masterpiece these two successes authorize me to vary the raw material still further in the absence of newborn caterpillars who are not always at my disposal i employ grubs which i have undressed that is to say which i have taken out of their caps to these divested ones i give as the only thing to work upon a strip of paper free from paste and easy to pick to pieces in short a piece of blottingpaper here again there is no hesitation the grubs lustily scrape this surface new to them though it be and make themselves a paper coat of it cadet roussel 28 of famous memory had a coat of similar stuff but much less fine and silky my paperclad charges are so wellpleased with their materials that they scorn their native case when it is afterwards placed at their disposal and continue to scrape lint from the industrial product others are given nothing in their tube but are able to get at the cork that closes the glass dwellinghouse this is enough the undraped ones hasten to scrape the cork to break it into atoms and out of these to make themselves a granulated frock as faultlessly elegant as though their race had always made use of this material the novelty of the stuff employed perhaps for the first time has made no change in the cut of the coat to sum up they accept any vegetable matter that is dry light and not too resistant would they behave likewise towards animal materials and especially mineral materials on condition that these are of a suitable thinness i take a great peacocks wing left over from my experiments in the nuptial telegraphy of this moth 29 and cut from it a strip on which i place at the bottom of a tube two little caterpillars stripped of their clothing the two prisoners have nothing else at their disposal any drapery that they want must be got out of this scaly expanse they hesitate for a long time in the presence of that strange carpet in twentyfour hours time one of the caterpillars has started no work and seems resolved to let himself die naked as he is the other stouterhearted or perhaps less injured by the brutal strippingprocess explores the slip for a little while and at last resolves to make use of it before the day is over he has clothed himself in grey velvet out of the great peacocks scales considering the delicacy of the materials the work is exquisitely correct let us go a step farther in our explorations for the soft yielding wadding collected from a plant or the down gleaned from the wing of a moth we will substitute rough stone in their final state i know the psyches cases are often laden with grains of sand and earthy particles but these are accidental bricks which have been inadvertently touched by the spinneret and incorporated unintentionally in the thatch the delicate creatures know too well the drawbacks of a pebbly pillow to seek the support of stone mineral matter is distasteful to them and it is mineral matter that now has to be worked like wool true i select such stones in my collection as are least out of keeping with the feeble powers of my grubs i possess a specimen of flaky hematite at the merest touch of a hairpencil it breaks into atoms almost as minute as the dust which a butterflys wing leaves on our fingers on a bed of this material which glitters like a steel filing i establish four young caterpillars extracted from their clothing i foresee a check in this experiment and consequently increase the number of my subjects it is as i thought the day passes and the four caterpillars remain bare next day however one one alone decides to clothe himself his work is a tiara with metallic facets in which the light plays with flashes of every colour of the rainbow it is very rich very sumptuous but mightily heavy and cumbrous walking becomes laborious under that load of metal even so must a byzantine emperor have progressed at ceremonies of state after donning his goldworked dalmatic poor little creature more sensible than man you did not select that ridiculous magnificence of your own free will it was i who forced it on you here to make amends is a disk of sorghumpith fling off your proud tiara thrust it from you quickly and place in its stead a cotton nightcap which is much healthier this is done on the second day the psyche has his favourite materials when starting as a manufacturer a vegetable lint collected from any ligneous scrap well softened by the air a lint usually supplied by the old roof of the maternal hut in the absence of the regulation fabric he is able to make use of animal velvet in particular of the scaly fluff of a moth in case of necessity he does not shrink from acts of sheer madness he weaves mineral matter so urgent is his need to clothe himself this need outweighs that of nourishment i take a young caterpillar from his grazingground a leaf of very hairy hawkweed which after many attempts i have found to suit him as food because of its green blade and as wool because of its white fleece i take him i say from his refectory and leave him to fast for a couple of days then i strip him and put him back on his leaf and i see him unmindful of eating in spite of his long fast first labouring to make himself a new coat by collecting the hairs of the hawkweed his appetite will be satisfied afterwards is he then so susceptible to cold we are in the midst of the dogdays the sun shoots down a fiery torrent that brings the wild concert of the cicadæ up to feverpitch in the baking heat of the study where i am questioning my animals i have flung off hat and necktie and am working in my shirtsleeves and in this oven what the psyche clamours for is above all things a warm covering well little shiverer i will satisfy you i expose him to the direct rays of the sun on the windowledge this time it is too much of a good thing i have gone beyond all bounds the sunscorched one wriggles about flourishes his abdomen always a sign of discomfort but the making of the hawkweed cassock is not suspended on this account on the contrary it is pursued more hurriedly than ever could this be because of the excessive light is not the cottonwool bag a retreat wherein the caterpillar isolates himself sheltering from the importunities of broad daylight and gently digests and sleeps let us get rid of the light while retaining a warm temperature after a preliminary stripping the little caterpillars are now lodged in a cardboard box which i place in the sunniest corner of my window the temperature here is well over 100 f no matter the swansdown sack is remade at a sitting of a few hours tropical heat and the quiet that goes with darkness have made no difference in the insects habits neither the degree of heat nor the degree of light explains the pressing need of raiment where are we to seek the reason for that hurry to get clad i can see none save a presentiment of the future the psyche caterpillar has the winter before him he knows nothing of a common shelter in a silken purse of cabins among closetouching leaves of underground cells of retreats under old cracked bark of hairy roofs of cocoons in short of the different methods employed by other caterpillars to protect themselves against the severity of the weather he has to spend the winter exposed to the inclemencies of the air this peril causes his particular talent he builds himself a roof whose imbricated and diverging stalks will allow cold dews and drops of melted snow to trickle away at a distance when the case is fixed and hanging vertically under this covering he weaves a thick silk lining which will make a soft mattress and a rampart against the effects of the cold once these precautions are taken the winter may come and the north wind rage the psyche is sleeping peacefully in his hut but all this is not improvised as the stormy season approaches it is a delicate work which takes time to carry out all his lifelong the caterpillar labours at it improving it adding to it strengthening it incessantly and in order to acquire greater skill he begins his apprenticeship at the moment when he leaves the egg as preliminary practice for the thick overcoat of fullgrown age he tries his hand on cotton capes even so does the pine processionary as soon as hatched weave first delicate tents then gauzy cupolas as harbingers of the mighty wallet in which the community will make its home both alike are harassed from the day of their birth by the presentiment of the future they start life by binding themselves apprentices to the trade that is to safeguard them one day no the psyche is not more sensitive to cold than any other smoothskinned caterpillar he is a creature of foresight deprived in winter of the shelters granted to the others he prepares himself from his birth for the building of a home that will be his salvation and practises for it by making fripperies of wadding suited to his strength he foresees the rigours of winter during the blazing dogdays they are now all clad my young caterpillars numbering nearly a thousand they wander restlessly in large glass receptacles closed with a sheet of glass what do you seek little ones swinging your pretty snowwhite cloaks as you go food of course after all that fatigue you need refreshment despite your numbers you will not be too heavy a burden on my resources you can manage with so little but what do you ask for you certainly do not count on me for your supplies in the open fields you would have found victuals to your liking much more easily than i can hope to find them for you since my wish to know all about you places you in my charge i have a duty which i must observe that of feeding you what do you want the part of providence is a very difficult one to play the purveyor of foodstuffs thinking of the morrow taking his precautions so that the home may be always more or less supplied performs the most deserving but also the most laborious of functions the little ones wait trustingly persuaded that things happen of themselves while he anxiously resorts to every kind of ingenuity and trouble wondering whether the right thing will come ah how well long practice has taught me to know the trade with all its worries and all its joys behold me today the providence of a thousand nurselings thrust upon me by my studies i try a little of everything the tender leaves of the elm appear to suit if i serve them up one day i find them next morning nibbled on the surface in small patches tiny grains of impalpable black dust scattered here and there tell me that the intestines have been at work this gives me a moment of satisfaction which will be readily understood by any breeder of a herd whose diet is unknown the hope of success gains strength i know how to feed my vermin have i discovered the best method at the first attempt i dare not think so i continue therefore to vary the fare but the results hardly come up to my wishes the flock refuses my assorted green stuff and even ends by taking a dislike to the elmleaves i am beginning to believe that i have failed utterly when a happy inspiration occurs to me i have recognized among the bits that go to form the case a few fragments of the mouseear hawkweed hieracium pilosella so the psyche frequents that plant why should he not browse it let us try the mouseear displays its little round flowers in profusion in a stony field just beside my house at the foot of the wall where i have so often found psychecases hanging i gather a handful and distribute it among my different folds this time the foodproblem is solved the psyches forthwith settle in solid masses on the hairy leaves and nibble at them greedily in small patches in which the epidermis of the other surface remains untouched we will leave them to their grazing with which they seem quite satisfied and ask ourselves a certain question relating to cleanliness how does the little psyche get rid of his digestive refuse remember that he is enclosed in a sack one dare not entertain the thought of ordure ejected and accumulating at the far end of the dazzling white plush cap filth cannot dwell under so elegant a covering how is the sordid evacuation managed despite the fact that it ends in a conical point in which the lens reveals no break of continuity the sack is not closed at the hinder end its method of manufacture by means of a waistband whose foreedge increases in dimensions in proportion as the rearedge is pushed farther back proves this sufficiently the hinder end becomes pointed simply owing to the shrinking of the material which contracts of itself at the part where the caterpillars decreasing diameter no longer distends it there is thus at the point a permanent hole whose lips remain closed the caterpillar has only to go a little way back and the stuff expands the hole widens the road is open and the excretions fall to the ground on the other hand so soon as the caterpillar takes a step forward into his case the rubbishshoot closes of itself it is a very simple and very ingenious mechanism as good as anything contrived by our seamstresses to cope with the shortcomings of a boys first pair of breeches meanwhile the grub grows and its tunic continues to fit it is neither too large nor too small but just the right size how is this done if the textbooks were to be credited i might expect to see the caterpillar split his sheath lengthwise when it became too tight and afterwards enlarge it by means of a piece woven between the edges of the rent that is what our tailors do but it is not the psyches method at all they know something much better they keep on working at their coat which is old at the back new in front and always a perfect fit for the growing body nothing is easier than to watch the daily progress in size a few caterpillars have just made themselves a hood of sorghumpith the work is perfectly beautiful it might have been woven out of snowflakes i isolate these smartlydressed ones and give them as weavingmaterials some brown scales chosen from the softest parts that i can find in old bark between morning and evening the hood assumes a new appearance the tip of the cone is still a spotless white but all the front part is coarse drapery very different in colouring from the original plush next day the sorghum felt has wholly disappeared and is replaced from one end of the cone to the other by a frieze of bark i then take away the brown materials and put sorghumpith in their stead this time the coarse dark stuff retreats gradually towards the top of the hood while the soft white stuff gains in width starting from the mouth before the day is over the original elegant mitre will be reconstructed entirely this alternation can be repeated as often as we please indeed by shortening each period of work we can easily obtain with the two sorts of material composite products showing alternate light and dark belts the psyche as you see in no way follows the methods of our tailors with their piece taken out and another piece let in in order to have a coat always to his size he never ceases working at it the particles collected are constantly being fixed just at the edge of the sack so that the new drapery increases progressively in dimensions keeping pace with the caterpillars growth at the same time the old stuff recedes is driven back towards the tip of the cone here through its own springiness it contracts and closes the muff any surplus matter disintegrates falls into shreds and gradually disappears as the insect roams about and knocks against the things which it meets the case new at the front and old at the back is never too tight because it is always being renewed after the very hot period of the year there comes a moment when light wraps are no longer seasonable autumnal rains threaten followed by winter frosts it is time to make ourselves a thick greatcoat with a cape of thatch arranged in a series of waterproof tippets it begins with a great lack of accuracy straws of uneven length and bits of dry leaves are fastened with no attempt at order behind the neck of the sack which must still retain its flexibility so as to allow the caterpillar to bend freely in every direction few as yet rather short and placed anyhow sometimes lengthways and sometimes across these untidy first logs of the roof will not interfere with the final regularity of the building they are destined to disappear and will be pushed back and be driven out at last as the sack grows in front later on when the pieces are longer and betterchosen they are all carefully laid longitudinally the placing of a straw is done with surprising quickness and dexterity if the log which he has found suits him the caterpillar takes it between his legs and turns it round and round gripping it with his mandibles by one end as a rule he removes a few morsels from this part and immediately fixes them to the neck of the sack his object in laying bare the raw and rough surfaces to which the silk will stick better may be to obtain a firmer hold even so the plumber gives a touch of the file at the point that is to be soldered then by sheer strength of jaw the caterpillar lifts his beam brandishes it in the air and with a quick movement of his rump lays it on his back the spinneret at once sets to work on the end caught and the thing is done without any groping about or correcting the log is added to the others in the direction required the fine days of autumn are spent in toil of this kind performed leisurely and intermittently when the stomach is full by the time that the cold weather arrives the house is ready when the air is once more warm the psyche resumes his walks abroad he roams along the paths strolls over the friendly greensward takes a few mouthfuls and then when the hour has come prepares for his transformation by hanging from the wall these springtime wanderings long after the case is completely finished made me want to know if the caterpillar would be capable of repeating his sackweaving and roofbuilding operations i take him out of his case and place him stark naked on a bed of fine dry sand i give him as materials to work with some old stalks of nîmes dandelion cut up into sticks of the same length as the pieces that make the case the evicted insect disappears under the heap of ligneous straws and hurriedly starts spinning taking as pegs for its cords anything that its lips encounter the bed of sand underfoot the canopy of twigs overhead so doing it binds together in extricable confusion all the pieces touched by the spinneret long and short light and heavy at random in the centre of this tangled scaffolding a work is pursued of a quite different nature from that of hutbuilding the caterpillar weaves and does nothing else not even attempting to assemble into a proper roofing the materials of which he is able to dispose the psyche owning a perfect case when he resumes his activity with the fine weather scorns his old trade as an assembler of logs a trade practised so zealously during the previous summer now that his stomach is satisfied and his silkglands distended he devotes his spare time solely to improving the quilting of his case the silky felt of the interior is never thick or soft enough to please him the thicker and softer it is the better for his own comfort during the process of transformation and for the safety of his family afterwards well my knavish tricks have now robbed him of everything does he perceive the disaster though the silk and timber at his disposal permit does he dream of rebuilding the shelter so essential first to his chilly back and secondly to his family who will cut it up to make their first home not a bit of it he slips under the mass of twigs where i let it fall and there begins to work exactly as he would have done under normal conditions this shapeless roof and this sand on which the jumble of rafters are lying now represent to the psyche the walls of the regulation home and without in any way modifying his labours to meet the exigencies of the moment the caterpillar upholsters the surfaces within his reach with the same zest that he would have displayed in adding new layers to the quilted lining which has disappeared instead of being pasted on the proper wall the present hangings come in contact with the rough surface of the sand and the hopeless tangle of the straws and the spinner takes no notice the house is worse than ruined it no longer exists no matter the caterpillar continues his actual work he loses sight of the real and upholsters the imaginary 30 and yet everything ought to apprise him of the absence of any roofing the sack with which he has managed to cover himself very skilfully for that matter is lamentably flabby it sags and rumples at every movement of the insects body moreover it is made heavy with sand and bristles with spikes in every direction which catch in the dust of the road and make all progress impossible thus anchored to the ground the caterpillar wastes his strength in efforts to shift his position it takes him hours to make a start and to move his cumbrous dwelling a fraction of an inch with his normal case in which all the beams are imbricated from front to back with scientific precision he gets along very nimbly his collection of logs all fixed in front and all free at the back forms a boatshaped sledge which slips and glides through obstacles without difficulty but though progress be easy retreat is impracticable for each piece of the framework causes the thing to stop owing to its free end well the sack of my victim is covered with laths pointing this way and that just in the position in which they happened to be caught by the spinneret as it fastened its threads here and there indiscriminately the bits in front are so many spurs which dig into the sand and neutralize all efforts to advance the bits at the side are rakes whose resistance cannot be overcome in such conditions the insect is bound to be stranded and to perish on the spot if i were advising the caterpillar i should say go back to the art in which you excel arrange your bundle neatly point the cumbrous pieces lengthwise in an orderly fashion do something to your sack which hangs too loosely give it the necessary stiffness with a few props to act as a busk do now in your distress what you knew so well how to do before summon up your old carpenteringtalents and you will be saved useless advice the time for carpentry is over the hour has come for upholstering and he upholsters obstinately padding a house which no longer exists he will perish miserably cut up by the ants as the result of his toorigid instinct many other instances have already told us as much like running water which does not climb slopes and which does not flow back to its source the insect never retraces its actions what is done is done and cannot be recommenced the psyche but now a clever carpenter will die for want of knowing how to fix a beam the great peacock it was a memorable evening i shall call it the great peacock evening who does not know the magnificent moth the largest in europe clad in maroon velvet with a necktie of white fur the wings with their sprinkling of grey and brown crossed by a faint zigzag and edged with smoky white have in the centre a round patch a great eye with a black pupil and a variegated iris containing successive black white chestnut and purple arcs no less remarkable is the caterpillar in colour an undecided yellow on the top of thinlyscattered tubercles crowned with a palisade of black hairs are set beads of turquoise blue his stout brown cocoon so curious with its exitshaft shaped like an eeltrap is usually fastened to the bark at the base of old almondtrees the caterpillar feeds on the leaves of the same tree well on the morning of the 6th of may a female emerges from her cocoon in my presence on the table of my insectlaboratory i forthwith cloister her still damp with the humours of the hatching under a wiregauze belljar for the rest i cherish no particular plans i incarcerate her from mere habit the habit of the observer always on the lookout for what may happen it was a lucky thought at nine oclock in the evening just as the household is going to bed there is a great stir in the room next to mine little paul halfundressed is rushing about jumping and stamping knocking the chairs over like a mad thing i hear him call me come quick he screams come and see these moths big as birds the room is full of them i hurry in there is enough to justify the childs enthusiastic and hyperbolical exclamations an invasion as yet unprecedented in our house a raid of giant moths four are already caught and lodged in a birdcage others more numerous are fluttering on the ceiling at this sight the prisoner of the morning is recalled to my mind put on your things laddie i say to my son leave your cage and come with me we shall see something interesting we run downstairs to go to my study which occupies the right wing of the house in the kitchen i find the servant who is also bewildered by what is happening and stands flicking her apron at great moths whom she took at first for bats the great peacock it would seem has taken possession of pretty well every part of the house what will it be around my prisoner the cause of this incursion luckily one of the two windows of the study had been left open the approach is not blocked we enter the room candle in hand what we see is unforgetable with a soft flickflack the great moths fly around the belljar alight set off again come back fly up to the ceiling and down they rush at the candle putting it out with a stroke of their wings they descend on our shoulders clinging to our clothes grazing our faces the scene suggests a wizards cave with its whirl of bats little paul holds my hand tighter than usual to keep up his courage how many of them are there about a score add to these the number that have strayed into the kitchen the nursery and the other rooms of the house and the total of those who have arrived from the outside cannot fall far short of forty as i said it was a memorable evening this great peacock evening coming from every direction and apprised i know not how here are forty lovers eager to pay their respects to the marriageable bride born that morning amid the mysteries of my study for the moment let us disturb the swarm of wooers no further the flame of the candle is a danger to the visitors who fling themselves into it madly and singe their wings we will resume the observation tomorrow with an experimental interrogatory thought out beforehand but first let us clear the ground and speak of what happens every night during the week that my observation lasts each time it is pitch dark between eight and ten oclock when the moths arrive one by one it is stormy weather the sky is very much overcast and the darkness is so profound that even in the open air in the garden far from the shadow of the trees it is hardly possible to see ones hand before ones face in addition to this darkness there is the difficulty of access the house is hidden by tall planetrees it is approached by a walk thickly bordered with lilac and rosetrees forming a sort of outer vestibule it is protected against the mistral by clumps of pines and screens of cypresses clusters of bushy shrubs make a rampart a few steps away from the door it is through this tangle of branches in complete darkness that the great peacock has to tack about to reach the object of his pilgrimage under such conditions the brown owl would not dare leave the hole in his olivetree the moth betterendowed with his faceted optical organs than the nightbird with its great eyes goes forward without hesitating and passes through without knocking against things he directs his tortuous flight so skilfully that despite the obstacles overcome he arrives in a state of perfect freshness with his big wings intact with not a scratch upon him the darkness is light enough for him even if we grant that it perceives certain rays unknown to common retinæ this extraordinary power of sight cannot be what warns the moth from afar and brings him hurrying to the spot the distance and the screens interposed make this quite impossible besides apart from deceptive refractions of which there is no question in this case the indications provided by light are so precise that we go straight to the thing seen now the moth sometimes blunders not as to the general direction which he is to take but as to the exact spot where the interesting events are happening i have said that the childrens nursery which is at the side of the house opposite my study the real goal of my visitors at the present moment was occupied by the moths before i went there with a light in my hand these certainly were illinformed there was the same throng of hesitating visitors in the kitchen but here the light of a lamp that irresistible lure to nocturnal insects may have beguiled the eager ones let us consider only the places that were in the dark in these there are several stray moths i find them more or less everywhere around the actual spot aimed at for instance when the captive is in my study the visitors do not all enter by the open window the safe and direct road only two or three yards away from the caged prisoner several of them come in downstairs wander about the hall and at most reach the staircase a blind alley barred at the top by a closed door these data tell us that the guests at this nuptial feast do not make straight for their object as they would if they derived their information from some kind of luminous radiation whether known or unknown to our physical science it is something else that apprises them from afar leads them to the proximity of the exact spot and then leaves the final discovery to the airy uncertainty of random searching it is very much like the way in which we ourselves are informed by hearing and smell guides which are far from accurate when we want to decide the precise point of origin of the sound or the smell what are the organs of information that direct the rutting moth on his nightly pilgrimage one suspects the antennæ which in the males do in fact seem to be questioning space with their spreading tufts of feathers are those glorious plumes mere ornaments or do they at the same time play a part in the perception of the effluvia that guide the enamoured swain a conclusive experiment seems to present no difficulty let us try it on the day after the invasion i find in the study eight of my visitors of the day before they are perched motionless on the transoms of the second window which is kept closed the others when their dance was over about ten oclock in the evening went out as they came in that is to say through the first window which is left open day and night those eight persevering ones are just what i want for my schemes with a sharp pair of scissors without otherwise touching the moths i cut off their antennæ near the base the patients take hardly any notice of the operation not one moves there is scarcely a flutter of the wings these are excellent conditions the wound does not seem at all serious undistraught by pain the moths bereft of their horns will adapt themselves all the better to my plans the rest of the day is spent in placid immobility on the crossbars of the window there are still a few arrangements to be made it is important in particular to shift the scene of operations and not to leave the female before the eyes of the maimed ones at the moment when they resume their nocturnal flight else the merit of their quest would disappear i therefore move the belljar with its captives and place it under a porch at the other end of the house some fifty yards from my study when night comes i go to make a last inspection of my eight victims six have flown out through the open window two remain behind but these have dropped to the floor and no longer have the strength to turn over if i lay them on their backs they are exhausted dying pray do not blame my surgical work this quick decreptitude occurs invariably even without the intervention of my scissors six in better condition have gone off will they return to the bait that attracted them yesterday though deprived of their antennæ will they be able to find the cage now put in another place at a considerable distance from its original position the cage is standing in the dark almost in the open air from time to time i go out with a lantern and a butterflynet each visitor is captured examined catalogued and forthwith let loose in an adjoining room of which i close the door this gradual elimination will enable me to tell the exact number with no risk of counting the same moth more than once moreover the temporary gaol which is spacious and bare will in no way endanger the prisoners who will find a quiet retreat there and plenty of room i shall take similar precautions during my subsequent investigations at half past ten no more arrive the sitting is over in all twentyfive males have been caught of whom only one was without antennæ therefore of the six on whom i operated yesterday and who were hale enough to leave my study and go back to the fields one alone has returned to the belljar it is a poor result on which i dare not rely when it comes to asserting or denying that the antennæ play a guiding part we must begin all over again on a larger scale next morning i pay a visit to the prisoners of the day before what i see is not encouraging many are spread out on the floor almost lifeless several of them give hardly a sign of life when i take them in my fingers what can i hope from these cripples still let us try perhaps they will recover their vigour when the time comes to dance the lovers round the twentyfour new ones undergo amputation of the antennæ the old hornless one is left out of count as dying or close to it lastly the prisondoor is left open for the remainder of the day he who will may leave the room he who can shall join in the evening festival in order to put such as go out to the test of searching for the bride the cage which they would be sure to notice on the threshold is once more removed i shift it to a room in the opposite wing on the groundfloor the access to this room is of course left free of the twentyfour deprived of their antennæ only sixteen go outside eight remain powerless to move they will soon die where they are out of the sixteen who have left how many are there that return to the cage in the evening not one i sit up to capture just seven all newcomers all sporting feathers this result would seem to show that the amputation of the antennæ is a rather serious matter let us not draw conclusions yet a doubt remains and an important one a nice state im in said mouflard the bullpup when his pitiless breeder had docked his ears how dare i show my face before the other dogs can it be that my moths entertain master mouflards apprehensions once deprived of their fine plumes dare they no longer appear amidst their rivals and awooing go is it bashfulness on their part or lack of guidance or might it not rather be exhaustion after a wait that exceeds the duration of an ephemeral flame experiment shall tell us on the fourth evening i take fourteen moths all new ones and imprison them as they arrive in a room where i intend them to pass the night next morning taking advantage of their daytime immobility i remove a little of the fur from the centre of their corselet the silky fleece comes off so easily that this slight tonsure does not inconvenience the insects at all it deprives them of no organ which may be necessary to them later when the time comes to find the cage it means nothing to the shorn ones to me it means the unmistakable sign that the callers have repeated their visit this time there are no weaklings incapable of flight at night the fourteen shaven moths escape into the open of course the place of the cage is once more changed in two hours i capture twenty moths including two tonsured ones no more of those who lost their antennæ two days ago not one puts in an appearance their nuptial time is over for good and all only two return out of the fourteen marked with a bald patch why do the twelve others hang back although supplied with what we have assumed to be their guides their antennary plumes why again that formidable list of defaulters which we find nearly always after a night of sequestration i perceive but one reply the great peacock is quickly worn out by the ardours of pairingtime with a view to his wedding the one and only object of his life the moth is gifted with a wonderful prerogative he is able to discover the object of his desire in spite of distance obstacles and darkness for two or three evenings he is allowed a few hours wherein to indulge his search and his amorous exploits if he cannot avail himself of them all is over the most exact of compasses fails the brightest of lamps expires what is the use of living after that stoically we withdraw into a corner and sleep our last sleep which is the end of our illusions and of our woes alike the great peacock becomes a moth only in order to perpetuate his species he knows nothing of eating while so many others jolly companions one and all flit from flower to flower unrolling the spiral of their proboscis and dipping it into the honeyed cups he the incomparable faster wholly freed from the bondage of the belly has no thought of refreshment his mouthparts are mere rudiments vain simulacra not real organs capable of performing their functions not a sup enters his stomach a glorious privilege save that it involves a brief existence the lamp needs its drop of oil if it is not to be extinguished the great peacock renounces that drop but at the same time he renounces long life two or three evenings just time enough to allow the couple to meet and that is all the big moth has lived then what is the meaning of the staying away of those who have lost their antennæ does it show that the absence of these organs has made them incapable of finding the wire bell in which the prisoner awaits them not at all like the shorn ones whose operation has left them uninjured they prove only that their time is up whether maimed or intact they are unfit for duty because of their age and their nonreturn is valueless as evidence for lack of the time necessary for experimenting the part played by the antennæ escapes us doubtful it was and doubtful it remains my caged prisoner lives for eight days every evening she draws for my benefit a swarm of visitors in varying numbers now to one part of the house now to another as i please i catch them as they come with the net and transfer them the moment they are captured to a closed room in which they spend the night next morning i mark them with a tonsure on the thorax the aggregate of the visitors during those eight evenings amounts to a hundred and fifty an astounding number when i consider how hard i had to seek during the following two years to collect the materials necessary for continuing these observations though not impossible to find in my near neighbourhood the cocoons of the great peacock are at least very rare for old almondtrees on which the caterpillars live are scarce in these parts for two winters i visited every one of those decayed trees at the lower part of the trunk under the tangle of hard grasses in which they are clad and time after time i returned emptyhanded therefore my hundred and fifty moths came from afar from very far within a radius of perhaps a mile and a half or more how did they know of what was happening in my study the perceptive faculties can receive information from a distance by means of three agents light sound and smell is it permissible to speak of vision in this instance i will readily admit that sight guides the visitors once they have passed through the open window but before that in the mystery out of doors it would not be enough to grant them the fabulous eye of the lynx which was supposed to see through walls we should have to admit a keenness of sight which could be exercised miles away it is useless to discuss anything so outrageous let us pass on sound is likewise out of the question the great fat moth capable of sending a summons to such a distance is mute even to the most acute hearing it is just possible that she possesses delicate vibrations passionate quivers which might perhaps be perceptible with the aid of an extremely sensitive microphone but remember that the visitors have to be informed at considerable distances thousands of yards away under these conditions we cannot waste time thinking of acoustics that would be to set silence the task of waking the surrounding air there remains the sense of smell in the domain of our senses scent better than anything else would more or less explain the onrush of the moths even though they do not find the bait that allures them until after a certain amount of hesitation are there in point of fact effluvia similar to what we call odour effluvia of extreme subtlety absolutely imperceptible to ourselves and yet capable of impressing a sense of smell betterendowed than ours there is a very simple experiment to be made it is a question of masking those effluvia of stifling them under a powerful and persistent odour which masters the olfactory sense entirely the toostrong scent will neutralize the very faint one i begin by sprinkling naphthaline in the room where the males will be received this evening also in the belljar beside the female i lay a big capsule full of the same stuff when the visitinghour comes i have only to stand in the doorway of the room to get a distinct smell of gasworks my artifice fails the moths arrive as usual they enter the room pass through its tarry atmosphere and make for the cage with as much certainty of direction as though in unscented surroundings my confidence in the olfactory explanation is shaken besides i am now unable to go on worn out by her sterile wait my prisoner dies on the ninth day after laying her unfertilized eggs on the wirework of the cage in the absence of a subject of experiment there is no more to be done until next year this time i shall take my precautions i shall lay in a stock so as to be able to repeat as often as i wish the experiments which i have already tried and those which i am contemplating to work then and that without delay in the summer i proclaim myself a buyer of caterpillars at a sou apiece the offer appeals to some urchins in the neighbourhood my usual purveyors on thursdays emancipated from the horrors of parsing 31 they scour the fields find the fat caterpillar from time to time and bring him to me clinging to the end of a stick they dare not touch him poor mites they are staggered at my audacity when i take him in my fingers as they might take the familiar silkworm reared on almondtree branches my menagerie in a few days supplies me with magnificent cocoons in the winter assiduous searches at the foot of the fostering tree complete my collection friends interested in my enquiries come to my assistance in short by dint of trouble much running about commercial bargains and not a few scratches from brambles i am the possessor of an assortment of cocoons of which twelve bulkier and heavier than the others tell me that they belong to females a disappointment awaits me for may arrives a fickle month which brings to naught my preparations the cause of so much anxiety we have winter back again the mistral howls tears the budding leaves from the planetrees and strews the ground with them it is as cold as in december we have to light the fires again at night and resume the thick clothes which we were beginning to leave off my moths are sorely tried they hatch late and are torpid around my wire cages in which the females wait one today another tomorrow according to the order of their birth few males or none come from the outside and yet there are some close at hand for the plumed gallants resulting from my harvest were placed out in the garden as soon as they were hatched and recognized whether near neighbours or strangers from afar very few arrive and these are only halfhearted they enter for a moment then disappear and do not return the lovers have grown cold it is also possible that the low temperature is unfavourable to the telltale effluvia which might well be enhanced by the warmth and decreased by the cold as happens with scents my year is lost oh what laborious work is this experimenting at the mercy of the sudden changes and deceptions of a short season i begin all over again for the third time i rear caterpillars i scour the country in search of cocoons when may returns i am suitably provided the weather is fine and responds to my hopes i once more see the incursions which had struck me so powerfully at the beginning at the time of the historic invasion which first led to my researches nightly the visitors turn up in squads of twelve twenty or more the female a lusty bigbellied matron clings firmly to the trelliswork of the cage she makes no movement gives not so much as a flutter of the wings seems indifferent to what is going on nor is there any odour so far as the most sensitive nostrils in the household can judge nor any rustle perceptible to the most delicate hearing among my family all of whom are called in to bear evidence in motionless contemplation she waits the others in twos or threes or more flop down upon the dome of the cage run about it briskly in every direction lash it with the tips of their wings in continual movement there are no affrays between rivals with not a sign of jealousy in regard to the other suitors each does his utmost to enter the enclosure tiring of their vain attempts they fly away and join the whirling throng of dancers some giving up all hope escape through the open window fresh arrivals take their places and on the top of the cage until ten oclock in the evening attempts to approach are incessantly renewed soon to be abandoned and as soon resumed every evening the cage is moved to a different place i put it on the north side and the south on the groundfloor and the first floor in the right wing and fifty yards away in the left in the open air or hidden in a distant room all these sudden displacements contrived if possible to put the seekers off the scent do not trouble the moths in the least i waste my time and ingenuity in trying to deceive them recollection of places plays no part here yesterday for instance the female was installed in a certain room the feathered males came fluttering thither for a couple of hours several even spent the night there next day at sunset when i move the cage all are out of doors ephemeral though they be the newest comers are ready to repeat their nocturnal expeditions a second time and a third where will they go first these veterans of a day they know all about the meetingplace of yesterday one is inclined to think that they will go back to it guided by memory and that finding nothing left they will proceed elsewhither to continue their investigations but no contrary to my expectations they do nothing of the sort not one reappears in the place which was so thickly crowded last night not one pays even a short visit the room is recognized as deserted without the preliminary enquiry which recollection would seem to demand a more positive guide than memory summons them elsewhere until now the female has been left exposed under the meshes of a wire gauze the visitors whose eyes are used to piercing the blackest gloom can see her by the vague light of what to us is darkness what will happen if i imprison her under an opaque cover according to its nature will not this cover either set free or arrest the telltale effluvia physical science is today preparing to give us wireless telegraphy by means of the hertzian waves can the great peacock have anticipated our efforts in this direction in order to set the surrounding air in motion and to inform pretenders miles away can the newlyhatched bride have at her disposal electric or magnetic waves which one sort of screen would arrest and another let through in a word does she in her own manner employ a kind of wireless telegraphy i see nothing impossible in this insects are accustomed to invent things quite as wonderful i therefore lodge the female in boxes of various characters some are made of tin some of cardboard some of wood all are hermetically closed are even sealed with stout putty i also use a glass belljar standing on the insulating support of a pane of glass well under these conditions of strict closing never a male arrives not one however favourable the mildness and quiet of the evening no matter its nature whether of metal or glass of wood or cardboard the closed receptacle forms an insuperable obstacle to the effluvia that betray the captives whereabouts a layer of cotton two fingers thick gives the same result i place the female in a large jar tying a sheet of wadding over the mouth by way of a lid this is enough to keep the neighbourhood in ignorance of the secrets of my laboratory no male puts in an appearance on the other hand make use of illclosed cracked boxes or even hide them in a drawer in a cupboard and notwithstanding this added mystery the moths will arrive in numbers as great as when they come thronging to the trellised cage standing in full view on a table i have retained a vivid recollection of an evening when the recluse was waiting in a hatbox at the bottom of a closed wallcupboard the moths arrived went to the door struck it with their wings knocked at it to express their wish to enter passing wayfarers coming no one knows whence across the fields they well knew what was inside there behind those boards we must therefore reject the idea of any means of information similar to that of wireless telegraphy for the first screen set up whether a good conductor or a bad stops the females signals completely to give these a free passage and carry them to a distance one condition is indispensable the receptacle in which the female is contained must be imperfectly closed so as to establish a communication between the inner and the outer air this brings us back to the probability of an odour though that was contradicted by my experiment with naphthaline my stock of cocoons is exhausted and the problem is still obscure shall i try again another year the fourth i abandon the thought for the fallowing reasons moths that mate at night are difficult to observe if i want to watch their intimate actions the gallant certainly needs no illuminant to attain his ends but my feeble human powers of vision cannot dispense with one at night i must have at least a candle which is often extinguished by the whirling swarm a lantern saves us from these sudden eclipses but its dim light streaked with broad shadows does not suit a conscientious observer like myself who wants to see and to see clearly nor is this all the light of a lamp diverts the moths from their object distracts them from their business and if persistent gravely compromises the success of the evening the visitors no sooner enter the room than they make a wild rush for the flame singe their fluff in it and thenceforth frightened by the scorching received cease to be trustworthy witnesses when they are not burnt when they are kept at a distance by a glass chimney they perch as close as they can to the light and there stay hypnotized one evening the female was in the diningroom on a table facing the open window a lighted paraffinlamp with a large whiteenamel shade was hanging from the ceiling two of the arrivals alighted on the dome of the cage and fussed around the prisoner seven others after greeting her as they passed made for the lamp circled about it a little and then fascinated by the radiant glory of the opal cone perched on it motionless under the shade already the childrens hands were raised to seize them dont i said leave them alone let us be hospitable and not disturb these pilgrims to the tabernacle of light all that evening not one of the seven budged next morning they were still there the intoxication of light had made them forget the intoxication of love with creatures so madly enamoured of the radiant flame precise and prolonged experiment becomes unfeasible the moment the observer requires an artificial illuminant i give up the great peacock and his nocturnal nuptials i want a moth with different habits equally skilled in keeping conjugal appointments but performing in the daytime before continuing with a subject that fulfils these conditions let us drop chronological order for a moment and say a few words about a latecomer who arrived after i had completed my enquiries i mean the lesser peacock attacus pavonia minor lin somebody brought me i dont know where from a magnificent cocoon loosely wrapped in an ample whitesilk envelope out of this covering with its thick irregular folds it was easy to extract a case similar in shape to the great peacocks but a good deal smaller the foreend worked into the fashion of an eeltrap by means of free and converging fibres which prevent access to the dwelling while permitting egress without a breach of the walls indicated a kinswoman of the big nocturnal moth the silk bore the spinners mark and in point of fact towards the end of march on the morning of palm sunday the cocoon with the eeltrap formation provides me with a female of the lesser peacock whom i at once seclude under a wiregauze bell in my study i open the window to allow the event to be made known all over the district i want the visitors if any come to find free entrance the captive grips the wires and does not move for a week a gorgeous creature is my prisoner in her brown velvet streaked with wavy lines she has white fur around her neck a speck of carmine at the tip of the upper wings and four large eyeshaped spots in which black white red and yellowochre are grouped in concentric crescents the dress is very like that of the great peacock but less dark in colouring i have seen this moth so remarkable for size and costume three or four times in my life it was only the other day that i first saw the cocoon the male i have never seen i only know that according to the books he is half the size of the female and of a brighter and more florid colour with orangeyellow on the lower wings will he come the unknown spark the plumewearer on whom i have never set eyes so rare does he appear to be in my part of the country in his distant hedges will he receive news of the bride that awaits him on my study table i venture to feel sure of it and i am right here he comes even sooner than i expected on the stroke of noon as we were sitting down to table little paul who is late owing to his eager interest in what is likely to happen suddenly runs up to us his cheeks aglow in his fingers flutters a pretty moth a moth caught that moment hovering in front of my study paul shows me his prize his eyes ask an unspoken question hullo i say this is the very pilgrim we were expecting lets fold up our napkins and go and see whats happening we can dine later dinner is forgotten in the presence of the wonders that are taking place with inconceivable punctuality the plumewearers hasten to answer the captives magic call they arrive one by one with a tortuous flight all of them come from the north this detail has its significance as a matter of fact during the past week we have experienced a fierce return of winter the north wind has been blowing a gale killing the imprudent almondblossoms it was one of those ferocious storms which as a rule usher in the spring in our part of the world today the temperature has suddenly grown milder but the wind is still blowing from the north now at this first visit all the moths hurrying to the prisoner enter the enclosure from the north they follow the movement of the air not one beats against it if their compass were a sense of smell similar to our own if they were guided by odoriferous particles dissolved in the air they ought to arrive from the opposite direction if they came from the south we might believe them to be informed by effluvia carried by the wind coming as they do from the north through the mistral that mighty sweeper of the atmosphere how can we suppose them to have perceived at a great distance what we call a smell this reflux of scented atoms in a direction contrary to the aerial current seems to me inadmissible for a couple of hours in radiant sunshine the visitors come and go outside the front of the study most of them search for a long while exploring the wall flitting along the ground to see their hesitation one would think that they were at a loss to discover the exact place of the bait that attracts them though they have come from very far without mistake they seem uncertain of their bearings once they are on the spot nevertheless sooner or later they enter the room and pay their respects to the captive without much importunity at two oclock all is over ten moths have been here all through the week each time at noonday when the light is at its brightest moths arrive but in decreasing numbers the total is nearly forty i see no reason to repeat experiments which could add nothing to what i already know and i confine myself to stating two facts in the first place the lesser peacock is a day insect that is to say he celebrates his wedding in the brilliant light of the middle of the day he needs radiant sunshine the great peacock on the contrary whom he so closely resembles in his adult form and in the work which he does as a caterpillar requires the dusk of the early hours of the night let him who can explain this strange contrast of habits in the second place a powerful aircurrent sweeping the other way any particles capable of instructing the sense of smell does not prevent the moths arriving from a direction opposite to that of the odoriferous flux as our physics imagine it if i am to go on with my observations i want a day moth not the lesser peacock who made his appearance too late at a time when i had nothing to ask him but another no matter whom provided that he be quick at discovering nuptial feasts shall i find this moth the banded monk yes i shall find him indeed i have him already a little chap of seven with a wideawake face that doesnt get washed every day bare feet and a pair of tattered breeches held up by a bit of string a boy who comes regularly to supply the house with turnips and tomatoes arrives one morning carrying his basket of vegetables after the few sous due to his mother for the greens have been counted one by one into his hand he produces from his pocket something which he found the day before beside a hedge while picking grass for the rabbits and what about this he asks holding the thing out to me what about this will you have it yes certainly ill have it try and find me some more as many as you can and ill promise you plenty of rides on the roundabout on sunday meanwhile my lad heres a penny for you dont make a mistake when you give in your accounts put it somewhere where you wont mix it up with the turnipmoney dazzled with delight at the sight of so much wealth my little ragamuffin promises to search with a will already seeing visions of a fortune to be his when he has gone i examine the thing it is worth while it is a handsome cocoon bluntshaped not at all unlike the product of our silkworm nurseries of a firm consistency and a tawny colour the cursory information which i have picked up from books of reference makes me almost certain that it is the bombyx of the oak the oak eggar if this is so what luck i shall be able to continue my observations and perhaps complete what the great peacock began to show me the oak eggar is in fact a classic there is not an entomological treatise but speaks of his exploits in the weddingseason they tell us how a mother hatches in captivity inside a room and even hidden in a box she is far away from the country amid the tumult of a big town the event is nevertheless divulged to those whom it concerns in the woods and the meadows guided by some inconceivable compass the males arrive hastening from the distant fields they go to the box tap at it fly round and round it i had read of these marvels but seeing seeing with ones own eyes and at the same time experimenting a little is quite another matter what does my penny purchase hold in store for me will the famous bombyx emerge from it let us call her by her other name the banded monk this unusual name of monk is suggested by the males dress a monks frock of a modest rusty brown but in this case the stuff is a delicious velvet with a pale transversal band and a little white eyeshaped dot on the front wings the banded monk is not in my region a common moth whom we are likely to catch if the fancy takes us to go out with a net at the proper season i have never seen it about the village especially not in my lonely enclosure during all the twenty years that i have spent here i am not a fervent hunter i admit the collectors dead insect interests me very little i want it alive in the full exercise of its faculties but i make up for the absence of the collectors zeal by an attentive eye for all that enlivens the fields a moth so remarkable in size and costume would certainly not have escaped me had i met him the little seeker whom i had caught so nicely with a promise of the roundabout never made a second find for three years i requisitioned friends and neighbours especially the youngsters those sharpeyed scrapers of the brushwood i myself scraped a great deal under masses of dead leaves inspected stoneheaps examined hollow treetrunks my trouble was in vain the precious cocoon was nowhere to be found suffice it to say that the banded monk is very scarce in my neighbourhood the importance of this detail will be seen when the time comes as i suspected my solitary cocoon did belong to the famous moth on the 20th of august there emerges a female corpulent and bigbellied attired like the male but in a lighter frock more in the nankeen style i establish her in a wiregauze belljar in the middle of my study on the big laboratorytable littered with books pots trays boxes testtubes and other engines of science i have described the setting before it is the same as in the case of the great peacock the room is lighted by two windows looking out on the garden one is closed the other is kept open day and night the moth is placed between the two in the shadow some four or five yards away the rest of the day and the following day pass without anything worth mentioning hanging by her claws to the front of the trelliswork on the side nearest the light the prisoner is motionless inert there is no waving of the wings no quivering of the antennæ even so did the female great peacock behave the mother bombyx matures her tender flesh hardens by some process of which our science has not the remotest idea she elaborates an irresistible bait which will bring callers flocking to her from the four corners of the heavens what takes place in that fat body what transformations are performed that shall presently revolutionize everything around were they known to us the moths nostrums would add a cubit to our stature on the third day the bride is ready the festivities burst into full swing i was in the garden already despairing of success so long were things delayed when at about three oclock in the afternoon in very hot weather and brilliant sunshine i saw a host of moths gyrating in the embrasure of the open window it is the lovers coming to call upon their sweetheart some are just leaving the room others going in others again are perched upon the wall resting as though jaded after a long journey i see some approaching in the distance over the walls over the curtain of cypresstrees they are hurrying up from all directions but becoming more and more rare i missed the beginning of the reception and the guests are nearly all here let us go upstairs this time in broad daylight without losing a single detail i once more witness the bewildering spectacle into which the great night moth initiated me my study is filled with a swarm of males whom i estimate at a glance to number about sixty as far as it is possible to make a count in this seething mass after circling a few times round the cage several go to the open window but return again forthwith and resume their evolutions the most eager perch on the cage hustle and trample on one another fighting for the good places inside the barrier the captive waits impassively with her great paunch hanging against the wires she gives not a sign of emotion in the presence of the turbulent throng going in or going out fussing round the cage or flitting through the room for more than three hours they keep up their frenzied saraband but the sun is sinking the temperature becomes a little cooler chilled likewise is the ardour of the moths many go out and do not come in again others take up their positions in readiness for the morrow they settle on the transoms of the closed window as the great peacocks did the celebration is over for today it will certainly be renewed tomorrow for it is still without result because of the wires but alas to my great dismay it is not renewed and this through my own fault late in the day some one brings me a praying mantis worthy of attention because of her exceptionally small size preoccupied with the events of the afternoon without thinking what i am doing i hastily place the carnivorous insect in the cage that holds my bombyx not for a moment do i dream that this cohabitation can turn out ill the mantis is such a little slender thing the other is so obese and thus i entertained no apprehensions ah little did i know the bloodthirsty fury of which the grapnelled insect is capable next morning to my bitter astonishment i find the tiny mantis devouring the huge moth the head and the front part of the breast have already disappeared horrible creature what a disappointment i owe to you farewell to my researches which i had cherished in my imagination all night long not for three years shall i be able to resume them for lack of a subject bad luck must not however make us forget the little that we have learnt at one sitting some sixty males came considering the rarity of the monk and remembering the years of fruitless searches conducted by my assistants and myself we stand astounded at this number with a female for a bait the undiscoverable has suddenly become a multitude now where did they come from from every quarter and from very far beyond a doubt during my years of exploration of my neighbourhood i have got to know every bush in it and every heap of stones and i am in a position to declare that there are no oak eggars there to make the swarm that filled my study the whole of the surrounding district must have contributed from this side and from that within a radius which i dare not determine three years pass and fortune persistently entreated at last grants me two monkcocoons towards the middle of august both of them within a few days of each other give me a female this is a piece of luck which will allow me to vary and renew my tests i quickly repeat the experiments which have already procured me a most positive reply from the great peacock the pilgrim of the day is no less clever than the pilgrim of the night he baffles all my tricks he hastens infallibly to the prisoner in her wiregauze cage in whatever part of the house the apparatus be installed he is able to discover her hidden in a cupboard he guesses her secret presence in a box of any kind provided that it be not tightly closed he ceases to come for lack of information when the casket is hermetically sealed thus far we see merely a repetition of the feats of the great peacock a wellclosed box the air contained in which does not communicate with the outer atmosphere leaves the monk in complete ignorance of the prisoners whereabouts not one arrives even when the box is exposed for every eye to see in the window this brings back more urgently than ever the idea of odoriferous effluvia intransmissible through a wall of metal cardboard wood or glass no matter which when put to the test the great night moth was not baffled by the naphthaline whose powerful smell ought to my thinking to mask ultrasubtle emanations imperceptible to any human nostrils i repeat the experiment with the monk this time i lavish all the resources in the way of scents and stenches that my store of drugs permits i place the saucers partly inside the wiregauze cage the females prison and partly all round it in a continuous circle some contain naphthaline others oil of lavender others paraffin others lastly alkaline sulphurs smelling of rotten eggs short of asphyxiating the prisoner i can do no more these arrangements are made in the morning so that the room may be thoroughly saturated when the trystinghour arrives in the afternoon the study has become an odious laboratory in which the penetrating aroma of lavenderoil and the foul stench of sulphuretted hydrogen predominate remember that i smoke in this room and plentifully at that will the concentrated odours of a gasworks a smokers divan a scentshop an oilwell and a chemical factory succeed in putting off the monk not at all a little before three the moths arrive as numerous as ever they go to the cage which i have taken pains to cover with a thick kitchencloth so as to increase the difficulty though they see nothing after they have entered though they are steeped in a foreign atmosphere in which any subtle fragrance should have been annihilated they fly towards the prisoner and try to get at her by slipping under the folds of the cloth my artifices are fruitless after this reverse so definite in its results which repeats what my naphthaline experiment with the great peacock taught me i ought logically speaking to give up the theory that odorous effluvia serve as a guide to the moths invited to the nuptial feast that i did not do so was due to a casual observation the unexpected the fortuitous often provides us with one of those surprises which show us the road to the truth hitherto sought in vain one afternoon trying to discover whether sight plays any part in the search once that the moths have entered the room i place the female in a glass belljar and give her a little oakbranch with withered leaves as a perch the apparatus is put on a table opposite the open window on entering the moths cannot fail to see the prisoner standing as she does where they are bound to pass the pan with its layer of sand in which the female spent the previous night and the morning under a wiregauze cover is in my way i put it without premeditation on the floor at the other end of the room in a corner which is only dimly lighted it is seven yards from the window the result of these preparations upsets all my ideas of the moths arriving none stops at the glass bell where the female is plainly visible in the full light they pass by with utter indifference not a glance in her direction not an enquiry they all fly right to the far end of the room to the dusky corner where i placed the tray and the cage they alight on the trellised top and explore it at length flapping their wings and hustling one another a little all the afternoon until sunset they dance around the deserted dome the same saraband to which the actual presence of the female would give rise at last they fly away but not all of them there are persistent ones who refuse to go rooted to the spot by some magic attraction a strange result indeed my moths hasten to where there is nothing take their stand there and will not be dissuaded by the repeated warnings of their eyes they pass without stopping for a moment by the bellglass in which the female cannot fail to be perceived by one or other of those coming and going befooled by a lure they pay no attention to the real thing what is it that deceives them the whole of the night before and all this morning the female has sojourned under the wiregauze cover either hanging to the trelliswork or resting on the sand in the pan whatever she touched above all with her fat belly apparently has become impregnated as the result of long contact with certain emanations there you have her bait her lovephiltre there you have what revolutionizes the world of monks the sand retains it for a time and spreads its effluvia around it is smell therefore that guides the moths that gives them information at a distance dominated by the sense of smell they take no notice of what their eyes tell them they pass by the glass prison in which their ladylove is now interned they go to the wires to the sand on which the magic cruets have shed their contents they race to the wilderness where naught remains of the witch but the scented evidence of her sojourn the irresistible philtre takes a certain time to elaborate i picture it as an exhalation which is gradually given off and saturates everything that touches the fat motionless creature when the glass bell stands directly on the table or better still on a square of glass the communication between the interior and the outer air is insufficient and the males perceiving nothing by the sense of smell keep away however long the experiment be continued at the actual moment i cannot substantiate this nontransmission through a screen for even if i establish ample communication if i separate the bell from its support by means of three wedges the moths do not come at first however many there may be in the room but wait for half an hour more or less the alembic of feminine flavours begins its distilling and the rush of visitors takes place as usual now that i possess these data this unexpected light on the subject i am at liberty to vary my experiments all of which lead to the same conclusion in the morning i establish the female under a wiregauze cover her perch is a little oaktwig similar to the last here motionless as though dead she remains for long hours buried in the tuft of leaves that is to be impregnated with her emanations when visitingtime approaches i withdraw the twig perfectly saturated and lay it on a chair near the open window on the other hand i leave the female under her cover well in view on the table in the middle of the room the moths arrive first one then two and three soon five and six they come in go out come in again fly up and down go to and fro keeping all the time to the neighbourhood of the chair with its oakbranch not one makes for the big table a few paces farther into the room where the female is waiting for them under the trellised dome they are hesitating that is clear they are seeking at last they find and what do they find the very twig which in the morning had served the potbellied matron as a bed with wings swiftly fluttering they alight upon the branch they explore it above and below probe it lift it and move it until at last the little bit of foliage drops on the floor the probing between the leaves continues none the less under the buffeting of the wings and the clawing of the feet the stick is now running along the ground like a scrap of paper pawed by a kitten while the twig is moving away with its band of explorers two new arrivals come upon the scene on their way they have to pass the chair which for a brief spell bore the leafy stick they stop at it and eagerly investigate the very spot which but now was covered by the branch and yet in their case as in that of the others the real object of their desires is close by them under a wire gauze which i have omitted to veil no one notices it on the floor the monks continue to hustle the mattress on which the female lay in the morning on the chair they still fumble at the spot where this bedding was first placed the sun goes down the time comes to depart besides the effluvia of passion are growing fainter are dispersing the visitors go away without more ado goodbye till tomorrow the following tests tell me that any material no matter what can take the place of the leafy branch that chance inspiration of mine some time in advance i place the female on a couch of cloth or flannel of wadding or paper i even subject her to the hardship of a campbed of wood glass marble or metal all these objects after a contact of sufficient length have the same powerful attraction for the males as the mother monk herself they retain this property to a varying extent according to their nature the best are wadding flannel dust sand in short porous objects metals marble and glass on the contrary soon lose their efficacy lastly anything on which the female has rested communicates its virtue to other places by simple contact as witness the moths crowding to the seat of the canebottomed chair after the oakbranch had fallen from it let us use one of the best beds flannel for instance and we shall see a curious thing i place at the bottom of a long testtube or of a narrownecked bottle just wide enough to allow of the moths passage a piece of flannel on which the mother has been lying all the morning the callers go into the vessels flounder about do not know how to get out again i have invented a mousetrap for them by means of which i could do terrific execution let us release the poor things remove the piece of stuff and put it away in an hermetically closed box the infatuated moths go back to the testtube headlong reenter the trap they are attracted by the effluvia which the saturated flannel has imparted to the glass i am fully convinced to summon the moths of the district to the wedding to apprise them at a distance of her presence and to guide them the bride emits an extremely subtle scent imperceptible to our own organs of smell with the mother monk held to their nostrils those around me perceive not the least odour not even the youngest whose senses are not yet vitiated this quintessence easily impregnates every object on which the female rests for any length of time and thenceforth the actual object becomes as potent a centre of attraction as the mother herself until the emanations are dispelled nothing visible betrays the bait on a piece of paper a recent restingplace around which the visitors crowd there is not an appreciable trace no moisture of any kind the surface is just as clean as before the impregnation the product is slowly elaborated and has to accumulate a little while before manifesting its full strength when taken from her couch and placed elsewhere the female loses her attractions for the time and becomes an object of indifference it is the restingplace saturated by long contact that draws the newcomers but the batteries are recharged and the deserted one recovers her power the appearance of the warning effluvium is delayed for a longer or shorter period according to the species the newlyhatched moth has to mature for a time and to put her distillery in order a female great peacock born in the morning sometimes has visitors that same evening but oftener on the second day after preparations lasting some forty hours the female banded monk adjourns her summons longer than that her banns of marriage are not published until after two or three days waiting let us return for a moment to the problematical functions of the antennæ the male monk sports a sumptuous pair similar to those of the great peacock who vies with him in his matrimonial expeditions are we to look upon these hairy feelers as a guiding compass i repeat without laying much stress on the matter my former amputations none of the patients comes back we must be chary of drawing inferences however the great peacock has shown us that the failure to return is due to more serious reasons than amputation of the horns moreover a second monk the clover bombyx nearly akin to the first and like him superbly plumed sets us an exceedingly perplexing problem he is fairly plentiful around my place even in the enclosure i find his cocoon which might easily be confused with that of the oak bombyx i am deceived at first by the resemblance out of six cocoons from which i expected to obtain banded monks six females of the other species hatch at the end of august well around those six females born in my house never a male appears though there is no doubt that the tufted ones are present in the neighbourhood if spreading feathered antennæ are really organs for receiving information at a distance why are not my richlyhorned neighbours informed of what is happening in my study why do their fine plumes leave them indifferent to events that would bring the banded monk hastening up in crowds once more the organ does not determine the aptitude this one is gifted and that one is not despite organic similarity the sense of smell in physics we hear of nothing nowadays but the röntgen rays which penetrate dense bodies and photograph the invisible for us a fine discovery but how insignificant in face of the surprises which the future reserves for us when betterinformed of the why and wherefore of things we supplement with art the feebleness of our senses and succeed in rivalling be it ever so little the keenness of perception revealed by the brute creation how enviable in many cases is this animal superiority it teaches us the poverty of our attainments it declares the mediocrity of our sensory apparatus it gives us evidence of impressions foreign to our nature it proclaims realities so far in excess of our attributes that they astound us a wretched caterpillar the pine processionary splits his back into meteorological airholes which snuff the coming weather and foretell the squall the bird of prey with its incomparably long sight sees from high in the clouds the fieldmouse squatting on the ground the blinded bats guide their flight without injury to themselves amid spallanzanis 32 inextricable maze of threads the carrierpigeon though moved a hundred leagues from home infallibly regains his cote across immensities which he has never traversed unaided within the limits of her humbler flight a bee the chalicodoma 33 also spans the unknown accomplishes a long journey and returns to her mass of cells the man who has never seen a dog hunting for truffles does not know one of the finest achievements of the sense of smell absorbed in its functions the animal trots along with its nose to the wind at a moderate pace it stops questions the ground with its nostrils scratches for a few seconds without undue excitement and looks up at its master here we are it seems to say here we are on my word of honour as a dog theres a truffle here and it speaks the truth the master digs at the point indicated if the trowel goes astray the dog shows the man how to put it right by sniffing at the bottom of the hole do not be afraid of the stones and roots in between despite the depth and intervening obstacles the tuber will come a dogs nose cannot lie subtlety of smell you say i have no objection if by that you mean that the animals nasal passages are the organ of perception but is the thing perceived always a mere smell in the ordinary acceptation of the word an effluvium such as our own senses understand it i have some reason to doubt this let us set the matter forth i have had the good fortune on several occasions to accompany a dog who was a great expert at his trade certainly he was nothing to look at this artist whom i was so anxious to see at work just a dog placid and deliberate in his ways ugly unkempt the sort of dog that you would never admit to your fireside talent and poverty often go hand in hand his master a celebrated rabassier 34 in the village convinced that i had no intention of stealing his secrets and one day setting up in competition allowed me to join him in his expeditions a favour which he did not often grant the worthy man was quite willing to fall in with my views once he saw that i was not an apprentice but merely an enquirer who made drawings 35 and wrote down lists of underground vegetable things instead of marketing my bagful of treasuretrove the glory of the christmas turkey it was agreed between us that the dog should act as he pleased and receive a bit of bread as his reward after each discovery indiscriminately every spot scratched up by his paws was to be dug and the object indicated extracted without our troubling about its commercial value in no case was the masters experience to intervene and divert the dog from a spot where practice told him that nothing saleable was to be found for in drawing up my botanical lists i preferred wretched and unmarketable products to the choicest morsels though these of course were welcomed when they appeared thus conducted the underground botanizing was very fruitful with his perspicacious nose the dog made me gather indifferently the large and the small the fresh and the putrid the scented and the unscented the fragrant and the stinking i was amazed at my collection which comprised the greater part of the hypogean fungi in my neighbourhood what a variety of structure and above all of odour the primary quality in this question of scent there are some that have nothing more noticeable than a vague fungous mustiness which is more or less evident in all some smell of turnips of rotten cabbage some are fetid enough to fill the collectors house with their stench the real truffle alone possesses the aroma dear to the epicure if smell as we understand it is the dogs only guide how does he manage to find his way through all these incongruous odours is he apprised of the contents of the soil by a general emanation the fungous effluvium common to the different species in that case an extremely embarrassing question arises i paid some attention to the ordinary mushrooms many of which as yet invisible announced their coming as imminent by cracking the surface of the ground now i never saw the dog stop at any of those points where my eyes divined the cryptogam pushing back the earth with the thrust of its cap points where the ordinary fungous smell was certainly most pronounced he passed them by scornfully with not a sniff with not a stroke of his paw and yet the thing was underground and its reek was similar to others which he sometimes pointed out to us i came back from the dogs school with the conviction that the truffledetecting nose has a better guide than smell in the sense in which our olfactory powers realize it it must perceive in addition effluvia of a different order full of mystery to us who are not equipped accordingly light has its dark rays which are without effect upon our retinæ but not apparently upon all why should not the domain of smell have its secret emanations unknown to our senses but perceptible to a differently constructed organ of smell if the scent of the dog leaves us perplexed to this extent that it is impossible for us to say exactly or even to suspect what it perceives it at least tells us plainly that we should be greatly mistaken to compare everything by human standards the world of sensations is far larger than the limits of our sensibility admit what a number of facts in the working of the forces of nature escape us for want of organs delicate enough to perceive them the unknown that inexhaustible field which the future will cultivate holds harvests in store for us beside which our present knowledge is but a pitiful gleaning under the sickle of science sheaves will one day fall whose grain today would seem a senseless paradox scientific illusions not so if you please but undeniable and positive realities affirmed by the animal world which in certain respects has a great advantage over the world of man in spite of his long professional practice in spite of the aroma of the tuber which he is seeking the rabassier cannot guess the presence of the truffle which ripens in winter underground at a depth of eighteen inches or so he needs the aid of the dog or the pig whose scent pries into the secrets of the soil well these secrets are known to different insects even better than to our two helpers in order to discover the tuber on which their family of grubs is to be fed they possess a scent of exceptional perfection long ago from truffles dug up spoilt and teeming with vermin and placed in this condition in a glass jar with a layer of fresh sand i obtained first a small red beetle anisotoma cinnamomea panz and then various diptera including a sapromyzon who with her sluggish flight and feeble frame reminds me of a fly clad in yellow velvet known as scatophaga scybalaria that placid frequenter of human excrement in autumn the latter finds her truffle on the surface of the ground at the foot of a wall or hedge mans usual hasty refuge in the country but how does the other know at what point underground lies hers or rather her grubs truffle to go down and hunt about in the depths is beyond her power her frail limbs which the moving of a grain of sand would warp her wings which if extended would block her way through a gorge her dress of stiff silk militating against a smooth passage these are all against her the sapromyzon is obliged to lay her eggs on the surface of the soil but she must do so at the very spot beneath which the truffle lies for the tiny grubs would die if they had to roam at random until they came upon their provender which is always sparsely distributed the trufflehunting fly is therefore informed by her sense of smell of the spots favourable to her maternal plans she possesses the scent of the rabassier dog indeed probably a better one for she knows things by nature having never been taught whereas her rival has only received an artificial education it would be interesting to follow the sapromyzons manœuvres but the idea strikes me as impracticable the insect is rare flies away quickly and is soon out of sight to observe it closely to watch it at work would involve a great loss of time and a degree of assiduity of which i do not feel capable another discoverer of underground fungi shall reveal what the fly could hardly be expected to show us this is a pretty little black beetle with a pale and velvety belly round as a cherrystone and much the same size the insects official title is bolboceras gallicus muls by rubbing the tip of its abdomen against the edge of its wingcases it emits a soft chirrup similar to that of the little birds when their mother comes home with their food the male wears a graceful horn on his head copied on a smaller scale from that of the spanish copris 36 deceived by this armour i at first took the insect for a member of the dungbeetles corporation and brought it up as such in captivity i served it with these stercoral dainties which are most appreciated by its presumed colleagues but never no never did it consent to touch them fie for shame dung to a bolboceras well what on earth did i take him for the epicure expects something very different he wants not exactly the truffle of our banquets but its equivalent this characteristic was not displayed to me without patient investigation on my part at the southern foot of the sérignan hills not far from the village stands a thicket of maritime pines alternating with rows of cypresstrees here at the season of all saints after the autumnal rains the mushrooms abound that frequent the coniferæ in particular the delicious milkmushroom which turns green at any part that is bruised and sheds tears of blood when you break it 37 in the mild days of autumn this is the favourite walk of my household being far enough to exercise young legs and near enough not to tire them they find everything there old magpies nests formed of bundles of twigs jays squabbling with one another after filling their crops with acorns on the oaks hard by rabbits suddenly starting out of a rosemarybush showing their little white upturned scuts geotrupes 38 hoarding away food for the winter and heaping up their rubbish on the threshold of the burrow and then lovely sand soft to the touch easy to dig into tunnels easy to build into rows of huts which we thatch with moss and surmount with a bit of reed by way of a chimney and the delicious lunch off an apple to the sound of the æolian harps softly sighing through the pineneedles yes for the children it is a real paradise where one goes as a reward for welllearnt lessons the grownups also have their share of enjoyment as far as i am concerned i have for many years been watching two insects here without succeeding in discovering their family secrets one of them is minotaurus typhœus 39 whose male carries on his corselet three spikes pointing in front of him the old writers used to call him the phalangist because of his armour which may be compared with the three lines of spears of the macedonian phalanx he is a robust fellow who cares nothing for the winter all through the cold season whenever the weather turns a trifle milder he leaves his house discreetly at nightfall and gathers in the immediate neighbourhood of his burrow a few sheepdroppings ancient oliveshaped remains dried by the summer sun he heaps them in a stack at the bottom of his larder shuts the door and eats when the provisions are all crumbed and drained of their niggardly juices he climbs back to the surface and renews his stores thus does he spend the winter never resting from his work except when the weather is too severe the second object of my observations in the pinewood is the bolboceras his burrows distributed here and there among those of the minotaur are easily distinguished the phalangists are surmounted by a bulky mound the materials of which are heaped into a cylinder as long as ones finger each of these rolls is a load of rubbish pushed outside by the digger thrusting with his back from below the orifice moreover is closed whenever the beetle is at home either enlarging the shaft or peacefully enjoying his possessions the bolboceras lodging is open and surrounded merely by a padding of sand its depth is slight nine inches hardly more it goes straight down in very loose soil it is easily inspected therefore if we take care first to dig a trench in front of it which will enable us later to cut away the perpendicular wall slice by slice with the blade of a knife the burrow then appears at full length from top to bottom in a semicylindrical shape often the violated dwellinghouse is empty the insect has left during the night having finished its business there and gone to settle elsewhere the bolboceras is a nomad a nightwalker who leaves his home without regret and easily acquires a new one sometimes also the insect is found at the bottom of the pit at one time a male at another a female but never the two at a time the sexes both equally zealous in digging burrows work separately not together this is not in fact a family residence containing the nursery of the young it is a temporary abode dug by each occupant for his own comfort sometimes we find nothing there but the wellsinker surprised during his work of excavation sometimes lastlyand the case is not uncommonthe hermit of the crypt embraces with his legs a small hypogean fungus either intact or partly consumed he clutches it convulsively refuses to be parted from it it is his booty his fortune his worldly goods scattered crumbs tell us that we have caught him feasting let us take his prize away from him we shall see a sort of irregular rugged purse closed on every side and varying in size between a pea and a cherry outside it is reddish rough with little warts inside it is smooth and white the spores which are ovoid and diaphanous are contained in rows of eight in long satchels by these characteristics we recognize an underground cryptogamous product nearly related to the truffles and known to botanists as hydnocystis arenaria tul this throws a light upon the habits of the bolboceras and upon the reason why his burrows are so frequently renewed in the calm of the twilight the little gadabout takes to the fields chirruping softly as he goes cheering himself with song he explores the soil questions it as to its contents just as the dog does when hunting for truffles his sense of smell warns him when the coveted morsel is underneath covered by a few inches of sand certain of the exact spot where the thing lies he digs straight down and never fails to reach it as long as the provisions last he does not go out again blissfully he feeds at the bottom of the well heedless of the door left open or hardly barred when no more food remains he moves looking for another loaf which will become the excuse for a fresh burrow to be abandoned in its turn each fungus consumed represents a new house which is a mere refectory a travellers refreshmentroom thus are the autumn and spring the seasons of the hydnocystis spent in the pleasures of the table from one home to the next to study the rabassier insect more closely in my own house i should need a little store of its favourite fare it would be waste of time to seek for it myself by digging at random the little cryptogam is not so plentiful that i can hope to strike it with my trowel without a guide the trufflehunter needs his dog my informer shall be the bolboceras himself behold me turned into a rabassier of a new kind i reveal my secret which can only raise a smile from my original instructor in underground botany if he should ever hear of my singular form of competition the subterranean fungi occur only at certain points often in groups now the beetle has been this way with his delicate scent he has recognized the site as good for the burrows are numerous hereabouts we will therefore dig near the holes the clue is accurate in a few hours thanks to the tracks left by the bolboceras i possess a handful of hydnocystes it is the first time that i have gathered this particular fungus let us now catch the insect that presents no difficulties we have only to dig up the burrows i make my experiments the same evening filling a large earthen pan with fresh sifted sand with a stick as thick as my finger i make six vertical tunnels in the sand two decimetres 40 deep and placed at a suitable distance apart a hydnocystis is lowered to the bottom of each and i insert a fine straw to show me the exact position later lastly i fill up the six cavities with caked sand when this surface has been carefully smoothed so that the level is everywhere the same except for the six straws landmarks that mean nothing to the bolboceras i let loose my captives covering them with a wiregauze cage there are eight of them at first there is nothing to see save the inevitable uneasiness due to the incidents of their exhumation transport and confinement in an unknown place my exiles from home try to escape climb up the wire burrow right at the edge of the enclosure night falls and things grow calmer two hours later i come to take a last look at them three are still buried under a thin layer of sand the five others have each dug a perpendicular shaft at the very foot of the straws which tell me where the fungi lie next morning the sixth straw has its well like the others this is the moment to see what is happening underground i remove the sand methodically in vertical slices at the bottom of each burrow is a bolboceras eating his truffle the hydnocystis let us repeat the experiment with the partlyconsumed victuals the result is the same at one brief nocturnal spell of work the dainty is discovered underground and reached by means of a gallery which runs plumb to the spot where the morsel lies there is no hesitation no trial excavation guided by guesswork this is proved by the surface of the soil which everywhere is just as i left it when i smoothed it down the insect could not have made straighter for the coveted object had it been guided by sight it always digs at the foot of the straws my signposts the dog nosing the ground for truffles hardly achieves this degree of precision has the hydnocystis then a very pungent smell able to give such positive information to its consumers scent not at all to our nostrils it is a neutral object devoid of any appreciable olfactory character a tiny pebble taken out of the ground would impress us just as much with its faint aroma of fresh earth as a revealer of underground fungous products the bolboceras here rivals the dog he would even rise superior to the dog were he able to generalize but he is a rigorous specialist he knows only the hydnocystis nothing else so far as i am aware tempts him to dig 41 both of them search the subsoil very closely at the level of the ground and the object which they seek is not far down were they farther away neither the dog nor the insect would notice effluvia so subtle not even the smell of a truffle to make an impression at a great distance powerful odours are needed capable of perception by our olfactory sense then the exploiters of the odorous thing come hastening up on all sides from afar when for the purpose of my studies i require insects that dissect corpses i expose a dead mole in the sun in a distant corner of the enclosure as soon as the animal swells distended by the gases of putrefaction and the skin begins to turn green and the fur to fall from it up come numbers of silphæ 42 and dermestes 43 necrophori 44 and other buryingbeetles of whom one would find not a single specimen in the garden or even in the neighbourhood without this bait they have been informed by their sense of smell at a great distance all around whereas i myself can avoid the stench by taking a few steps back compared with their scent mine is contemptible but still in their case as well as mine there is really here what our language calls a smell i can do better still with the flower of the dragon arum arum dracunculus so remarkable for its shape and for its unequalled stench imagine a wide lanceolate blade of a clarety purple half a yard long and rolled below into an ovoid pouch the size of a hens egg through the opening of this wallet rises a central column springing from the bottom a long brightgreen club encircled at its base by two bracelets one of ovaries the other of stamens such briefly described is the flower or rather the inflorescence of the dragon arum for two days it exhales a frightful stench of carrion worse than the proximity of a dead dog would yield during the hottest part of the day with a wind blowing it is loathsome unbearable let us brave the infected atmosphere and go up to it we shall behold a curious sight informed by the foul odour which spreads far and wide various insects come flying along such insects as make sausagemeat of small corpsestoads adders lizards hedgehogs moles fieldmicewhich the husbandman hits with his spade and flings away disembowelled on the footpath they swoop down upon the great leaf which with its livid purple looks like a strip of meat gone bad they caper about intoxicated by the smell of corpse which they love they roll down the slope and are swallowed up in the purse after a few hours of bright sunshine the receptacle is full let us look inside through the narrow opening no elsewhere could you see such a crowd it is a mad whirl of backs and bellies of wingcases and legs swarming rolling over and over amid the snap of interlocked joints rising and falling floating and sinking seething and bubbling without end it is a drunken revel an epidemic of delirium tremens some few as yet emerging from the mass climb to the opening by means of the central pole or the walls of the enclosure will they take wing and make their escape not they standing on the brink of the chasm almost free they drop back into the whirlpool in a fresh bout of intoxication the bait is irresistible not one of them will quit the assembly until the evening or perhaps next morning when the heady fumes have evaporated then the mass becomes disentangled and the insects extricate themselves from one anothers embraces and slowly as it were regretfully leave the place and fly away at the bottom of this devils purse remains a heap of dead and dying of severed limbs and disjointed wingcases the inevitable result of the frenzied orgy soon woodlice earwigs and ants will arrive and devour the deceased what were they doing there were they the prisoners of the flower had it converted itself into a trap which allowed them to enter but prevented them from escaping by means of a fence of converging hairs no they were not prisoners they had full liberty to go away as is shown by the final exodus which is effected without impediment deceived by a false odour were they doing their best to instal their eggs as they would have done under a corpse not that either there is no trace of an attempt at egglaying in the dragons purse they came enticed by the smell of a dead body their supreme delight they were drunk with corpse and they spun round frantically in an undertakers carnival when the bacchanal dance is at its height i try to count the number of the arrivals i rip up the floral pouch and pour its contents into a flask absolutely tipsy though they be many would escape during the census which i wish to take accurately a few drops of carbon bisulphide deprive the crowd of motion the counting then shows that there were over four hundred such was the living billow which i saw surging just now in the dragons purse the throng consists entirely of two families dermestes and saprini 45 both of whom are very busy in spring turning derelict corpses to account here is a complete list of the visitors to a single flower with the number of representatives of each species dermestes frischii kugel 120 d undulatus brahm 90 d pardalis schoenh 1 saprinus subnitidus de mars 160 s maculatus ross 4 s detersus illig 15 s semipunctatus de mars 12 s œneus fabr 2 s speculifer latr 2 total 406 another detail deserves attention just as much as this enormous figure and that is the complete absence of a number of other genera which are as passionately fond of small corpses as are the dermestes and saprini my charnelhouses of moles never fail to be visited by the silphæ and necrophori silpha sinuata fabr s rugosa lin s obscura lin necrophorus vestigator hersch the reek of the dragon arum leaves them all indifferent none of them is represented in the ten flowers which i examine nor are any diptera those other devotees of corruption several flies some grey or bluey others a metallic green come up it is true settle on the edge of the flower and even find their way into the fetid wallet but they are almost immediately undeceived and fly away only the dermestes and saprini stay behind why my friend bull as decent a dog as ever lived had this among many other eccentricities if he found in the dust of the road the dried up corpse of a mole flattened under the heels of the passersby mummified by the heat of the sun he would revel in rolling himself over it from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail he would rub himself in it over and over again shaken with nervous spasms turning first on one side then on the other it was his sachet of musk his flask of eaudecologne when scented to his liking he would get up shake himself and trot off pleased as punch with his pomade let us not abuse him and above all let us not discuss the matter there are tastes of all kinds in this world why should not some of the insects that dote on the smell of the dead have similar habits dermestes and saprini come to the dragon arum all day long they swarm in throngs although free to go away many of them die in the riot of the orgy it is no rich provender that keeps them for the flower gives them nothing to eat it is not a question of laying eggs for they take good care not to settle their grubs in that faminestricken spot what are they doing here the frenzied ones apparently intoxicating themselves with fetidness just as bull did on the carcass of a mole and this intoxication of smell attracts them from every part around from very far perhaps one cannot tell even so the necrophori in quest of an establishment for their young hasten from the fields to my putrefying moles both are informed by a potent smell which offends our nostrils sixty yards away but which travels ahead and delights them at distances where our own power of scent ceases the hydnocystis the bolboceras treat has none of these violent emanations capable of being diffused through space it is devoid of smell at least to us the insect that hunts for it does not come from a distance it inhabits the very places where the cryptogam lies however faint the effluvia of the underground morsel the prying epicure equipped for the purpose has every facility for perceiving them he operates close by on the surface of the soil the dogs case is the same he goes along searching with his nose to the ground then too the real truffle the essential object of his quest possesses a most pronounced odour but what are we to say of the great peacock and the banded monk making their way to the female born in captivity they hasten from the ends of the horizon what do they perceive at that distance is it really an odour as our physiology understands the word i cannot bring myself to believe it the dog smells the truffle by sniffing the earth quite close to the tuber he finds his master at great distances by consulting the scent of his footprints but is he able to discover the truffle hundreds of yards away miles away can he join his master in the complete absence of a trail certainly not for all his fineness of scent the dog is incapable of such a feat which is performed however by the moth who is put off neither by distance nor by the lack of any traces out of doors of the female hatched on my table it is a recognized fact that smell ordinary smell the smell that affects our nostrils consists of molecules emanating from the scented body the odorous matter dissolves and is diffused throughout the air by communicating to the air its aroma even as sugar dissolves and is diffused in water by communicating to the water its sweetness smell and taste touch each other at some points in both cases there is a contact between the material particles that give the impression and the sensitive papillæ that receive it nothing can be simpler or clearer than that the dragon arum elaborates an intensely strong essence with which the air is impregnated and infected all around thus the dermestes and saprini those passionate lovers of carrion smells are informed by molecular diffusion in the same way the putrid toad gives out and disseminates the stinking atoms that are the necrophorus delight but what is materially emitted by the female bombyx or great peacock nothing according to our sense of smell and this nothing is supposed when the males congregate to saturate an immense circle several miles in radius with its molecules what the horrible stench of the dragon arum is unable to do the absence of odour is believed to accomplish however divisible matter may be the mind refuses to accept such conclusions it would be tantamount to reddening a lake with an atom of carmine to filling immensity with nothing another argument when my study is saturated beforehand with pungent odours which ought to overcome and destroy the most delicate effluvia the male moths arrive without the least sign of embarrassment a loud noise kills the faint note and prevents it from being heard a bright light eclipses a feeble gleam these are waves of the same nature but the roar of thunder cannot cause the least jet of light to pale nor can the dazzling glory of the sun stifle the least sound being of different natures light and sound do not influence each other the experiment with the lavenderoil naphthaline and the rest would therefore seem to prove that odour proceeds from two sources for emission substitute undulation and the problem of the great peacock is explained without losing any of its substance a luminous point shakes the ether with its vibrations and fills a circle of indefinite width with light this must almost express the working of the mother bombyx telltale discharge it does not emit molecules it vibrates it sets in motion waves capable of spreading to distances incompatible with a real diffusion of matter in its entirety smell would thus seem to have two domains that of the particles dissolved in the air and that of the ethereal waves the first alone is known to us it belongs also to the insect it is this which informs the saprinus of the dragon arums fetidity and the silpha and necrophorus of the stench of the mole the second which is far superior in its range through space escapes us altogether because we lack the necessary sensory equipment the great peacock and the banded monk know it at the time of the nuptial rejoicings and many others must share it in various degrees according to the exigencies of their mode of life like light odour has its xrays should science one day instructed by the insect endow us with a radiograph of smells this artificial nose will open out to us a world of marvels the cabbagecaterpillar the cabbage of our modern kitchengardens is a semiartificial plant the produce of our agricultural ingenuity quite as much as of the niggardly gifts of nature spontaneous vegetation supplied us with the longstalked scantyleaved illsmelling wilding as found according to the botanists on the ocean cliffs he had need of a rare inspiration who first showed faith in this rustic clown and proposed to improve it in his gardenpatch progressing by infinitesimal degrees culture wrought miracles it began by persuading the wild cabbage to discard its wretched leaves beaten by the seawinds and to replace them by others ample and fleshy and closefitting the gentle cabbage submitted without protest it deprived itself of the joys of light by arranging its leaves in a large compact head white and tender in our day among the successors of those first tiny hearts are some that by virtue of their massive bulk have earned the glorious name of chou quintal as who should say a hundredweight of cabbage they are real monuments of green stuff later man thought of obtaining a generous dish with the thousand little sprays of the inflorescence the cabbage consented under the cover of the central leaves it gorged with food its sheaves of blossom its flowerstalks its branches and worked the lot into a fleshy conglomeration this is the cauliflower the broccoli differently entreated the plant economizing in the centre of its shoot set a whole family of closewrapped cabbages ladderwise on a tall stem a multitude of dwarf leafbuds took the place of the colossal head this is the brussels sprout next comes the turn of the stump an unprofitable almost wooden thing which seemed never to have any other purpose than to act as a support for the plant but the tricks of gardeners are capable of everything so much so that the stalk yields to the growers suggestions and becomes fleshy and swells into an ellipse similar to the turnip of which it possesses all the merits of corpulence flavour and delicacy only the strange product serves as a base for a few sparse leaves the last protests of a real stem that refuses to lose its attributes entirely this is the colerape if the stem allows itself to be allured why not the root it does in fact yield to the blandishments of agriculture it dilates its pivot into a flat turnip which half emerges from the ground this is the rutabaga or swede the turnipcabbage of our northern districts incomparably docile under our nursing the cabbage has given its all for our nourishment and that of our cattle its leaves its flowers its buds its stalk its root all that it now wants is to combine the ornamental with the useful to smarten itself to adorn our flowerbeds and cut a good figure on a drawingroom table it has done this to perfection not with its flowers which in their modesty continue intractible but with its curly and variegated leaves which have the undulating grace of ostrichfeathers and the rich colouring of a mixed bouquet none who beholds it in this magnificence will recognize the near relation of the vulgar greens that form the basis of our cabbagesoup the cabbage first in order of date in our kitchengardens was held in high esteem by classic antiquity next after the bean and later the pea but it goes much farther back so far indeed that no memories of its acquisition remain history pays but little attention to these details it celebrates the battlefields whereon we meet our death it scorns to speak of the ploughed fields whereby we thrive it knows the names of the kings bastards it cannot tell us the origin of wheat that is the way of human folly this silence respecting the precious plants that serve as food is most regrettable the cabbage in particular the venerable cabbage that denizen of the most ancient gardenplots would have had extremely interesting things to teach us it is a treasure in itself but a treasure twice exploited first by man and next by the caterpillar of the pieris the common large white butterfly whom we all know pieris brassicæ lin this caterpillar feeds indiscriminately on the leaves of all varieties of cabbage however dissimilar in appearance he nibbles with the same appetite red cabbage and broccoli curly greens and savoy swedes and turniptops in short all that our ingenuity lavish of time and patience has been able to obtain from the original plant since the most distant ages but what did the caterpillar eat before our cabbages supplied him with copious provender obviously the pieris did not wait for the advent of man and his horticultural works in order to take part in the joys of life she lived without us and would have continued to live without us a butterflys existence is not subject to ours but rightfully independent of our aid before the whiteheart the cauliflower the savoy and the others were invented the pieris caterpillar certainly did not lack food he browsed the wild cabbage of the cliffs the parent of all the latterday wealth but as this plant is not widely distributed and is in any case limited to certain maritime regions the welfare of the butterfly whether on plain or hill demanded a more luxuriant and more common plant for pasturage this plant was apparently one of the cruciferæ more or less seasoned with sulphuretted essence like the cabbages let us experiment on these lines i rear the pieris caterpillars from the egg upwards on the wallrocket diplotaxis tenuifolia dec which imbibes strong spices along the edge of the paths and at the foot of the walls penned in a large wiregauze bellcage they accept this provender without demur they nibble it with the same appetite as if it were cabbage and they end by producing chrysalids and butterflies the change of fare causes not the least trouble i am equally successful with other crucifers of a less marked flavour white mustard sinapis incana lin dyers woad isatis tinctoria lin wild radish raphanus raphanistrum lin whitlow pepperwort lepidium draba lin hedgemustard sisymbrium officinale scop on the other hand the leaves of the lettuce the bean the pea the cornsalad are obstinately refused let us be content with what we have seen the fare has been sufficiently varied to show us that the cabbagecaterpillar feeds exclusively on a large number of crucifers perhaps even on all as these experiments are made in the enclosure of a bellcage one might imagine that captivity impels the flock to feed in the absence of better things on what it would refuse were it free to hunt for itself having naught else within their reach the starvelings consume any and all cruciferæ without distinction of species can things sometimes be the same in the open fields where i play none of my tricks can the family of the white butterfly be settled on other crucifers than the cabbage i start a quest along the paths near the gardens and end by finding on wild radish and white mustard colonies as crowded and prosperous as those established on cabbage now except when the metamorphosis is at hand the caterpillar of the white butterfly never travels he does all his growing on the identical plant whereon he saw the light the caterpillars observed on the wild radish as well as other households are not therefore emigrants who have come as a matter of fancy from some cabbagepatch in the neighbourhood they have hatched on the very leaves where i find them hence i arrive at this conclusion the white butterfly who is fitful in her flight chooses cabbage first to dab her eggs upon and different cruciferæ next varying greatly in appearance how does the pieris manage to know her way about her botanical domain we have seen the larini 46 those explorers of fleshy receptacles with an artichoke flavour astonish us with their knowledge of the flora of the thistle tribe but their lore might at a pinch be explained by the method followed at the moment of housing the egg with their rostrum they prepare niches and dig out basins in the receptacle exploited and consequently they taste the thing a little before entrusting their eggs to it on the other hand the butterfly a nectardrinker makes not the least enquiry into the savoury qualities of the leafage at most dipping her proboscis into the flowers she abstracts a mouthful of syrup this means of investigation moreover would be of no use to her for the plant selected for the establishing of her family is for the most part not yet in flower the mother flits for a moment around the plant and that swift examination is enough the emission of eggs takes place if the provender be found suitable the botanist to recognize a crucifer requires the indications provided by the flower here the pieris surpasses us she does not consult the seedvessel to see if it be long or short nor yet the petals four in number and arranged in a cross because the plant as a rule is not in flower and still she recognizes offhand what suits her caterpillars in spite of profound differences that would embarrass any but a botanical expert unless the pieris has an innate power of discrimination to guide her it is impossible to understand the great extent of her vegetable realm she needs for her family cruciferæ nothing but cruciferæ and she knows this group of plants to perfection i have been an enthusiastic botanist for half a century and more nevertheless to discover if this or that plant new to me is or is not one of the cruciferæ in the absence of flowers and fruits i should have more faith in the butterflys statements than in all the learned records of the books where science is apt to make mistakes instinct is infallible the pieris has two families a year one in april and may the other in september the cabbagepatches are renewed in those same months the butterflys calendar tallies with the gardeners the moment that provisions are in sight consumers are forthcoming for the feast the eggs are a bright orangeyellow and do not lack prettiness when examined under the lens they are blunted cones ranged side by side on their round base and adorned with finelyscored longitudinal ridges they are collected in slabs sometimes on the upper surface when the leaf that serves as a support is spread wide sometimes on the lower surface when the leaf is pressed to the next ones their number varies considerably slabs of a couple of hundred are pretty frequent isolated eggs or eggs collected in small groups are on the contrary rare the mothers output is affected by the degree of quietness at the moment of laying the outer circumference of the group is irregularly formed but the inside presents a certain order the eggs are here arranged in straight rows backing against one another in such a way that each egg finds a double support in the preceding row this alternation without being of an irreproachable precision gives a fairly stable equilibrium to the whole to see the mother at her laying is no easy matter when examined too closely the pieris decamps at once the structure of the work however reveals the order of the operations pretty clearly the ovipositor swings slowly first in this direction then in that by turns and a new egg is lodged in each space between two adjoining eggs in the previous row the extent of the oscillation determines the length of the row which is longer or shorter according to the layers fancy the hatching takes place in about a week it is almost simultaneous for the whole mass as soon as one caterpillar comes out of its egg the others come out also as though the natal impulse were communicated from one to the other in the same way in the nest of the praying mantis a warning seems to be spread abroad arousing every one of the population it is a wave propagated in all directions from the point first struck the egg does not open by means of a dehiscence similar to that of the vegetablepods whose seeds have attained maturity it is the newborn grub itself that contrives an exitway by gnawing a hole in its enclosure in this manner it obtains near the top of the cone a symmetrical dormerwindow cleanedged with no joins nor unevenness of any kind showing that this part of the wall has been nibbled away and swallowed but for this breach which is just wide enough for the deliverance the egg remains intact standing firmly on its base it is now that the lens is best able to take in its elegant structure what it sees is a bag made of ultrafine goldbeatersskin translucent stiff and white retaining the complete form of the original egg a score of streaked and knotted lines run from the top to the base it is the wizards pointed cap the mitre with the grooves carved into jewelled chaplets all said the cabbagecaterpillars birthcasket is an exquisite work of art the hatching of the lot is finished in a couple of hours and the swarming family musters on the layer of swaddlingclothes still in the same position for a long time before descending to the fostering leaf it lingers on this kind of hotbed is even very busy there busy with what it is browsing a strange kind of grass the handsome mitres that remain standing on end slowly and methodically from top to base the newborn grubs nibble the wallets whence they have just emerged by tomorrow nothing is left of these but a pattern of round dots the bases of the vanished sacks as his first mouthfuls therefore the cabbagecaterpillar eats the membranous wrapper of his egg this is a regulation diet for i have never seen one of the little grubs allow itself to be tempted by the adjacent green stuff before finishing the ritual repast whereat skin bottles furnish forth the feast it is the first time that i have seen a larva make a meal of the sack in which it was born of what use can this singular fare be to the budding caterpillar i suspect as follows the leaves of the cabbage are waxed and slippery surfaces and nearly always slant considerably to graze on them without risking a fall which would be fatal in earliest childhood is hardly possible unless with moorings that afford a steady support what is needed is bits of silk stretched along the road as fast as progress is made something for the legs to grip something to provide a good anchorage even when the grub is upside down the silktubes where those moorings are manufactured must be very scantily supplied in a tiny newborn animal and it is expedient that they be filled without delay with the aid of a special form of nourishment then what shall the nature of the first food be vegetable matter slow to elaborate and niggardly in its yield does not fulfil the desired conditions at all well for time presses and we must trust ourselves safely to the slippery leaf an animal diet would be preferable it is easier to digest and undergoes chemical changes in a shorter time the wrapper of the egg is of a horny nature as silk itself is it will not take long to transform the one into the other the grub therefore tackles the remains of its egg and turns it into silk to carry with it on its first journeys if my surmise is wellfounded there is reason to believe that with a view to speedily filling the silkglands to which they look to supply them with ropes other caterpillars beginning their existence on smooth and steeplyslanting leaves also take as their first mouthful the membranous sack which is all that remains of the egg the whole of the platform of birthsacks which was the first campingground of the white butterflys family is razed to the ground naught remains but the round marks of the individual pieces that composed it the structure of piles has disappeared the prints left by the piles remain the little caterpillars are now on the level of the leaf which shall henceforth feed them they are a pale orangeyellow with a sprinkling of white bristles the head is a shiny black and remarkably powerful it already gives signs of the coming gluttony the little animal measures scarcely two millimetres 47 in length the troop begins its steadyingwork as soon as it comes into contact with its pasturage the green cabbageleaf here there in its immediate neighbourhood each grub emits from its spinningglands short cables so slender that it takes an attentive lens to catch a glimpse of them this is enough to ensure the equilibrium of the almost imponderable atom the vegetarian meal now begins the grubs length promptly increases from two millimetres to four soon a moult takes place which alters its costume its skin becomes speckled on a paleyellow ground with a number of black dots intermingled with white bristles three or four days of rest are necessary after the fatigue of breaking cover when this is over the hungerfit starts that will make a ruin of the cabbage within a few weeks what an appetite what a stomach working continuously day and night it is a devouring laboratory through which the foodstuffs merely pass transformed at once i serve up to my caged herd a bunch of leaves picked from among the biggest two hours later nothing remains but the thick midribs and even these are attacked when there is any delay in renewing the victuals at this rate a hundredweightcabbage doled out leaf by leaf would not last my menagerie a week the gluttonous animal therefore when it swarms and multiplies is a scourge how are we to protect our gardens against it in the days of pliny the great latin naturalist a stake was set up in the middle of the cabbagebed to be preserved and on this stake was fixed a horses skull bleached in the sun a mares skull was considered even better this sort of bogey was supposed to ward off the devouring brood my confidence in this preservative is but an indifferent one my reason for mentioning it is that it reminds me of a custom still observed in our own days at least in my part of the country nothing is so longlived as absurdity tradition has retained in a simplified form the ancient defensive apparatus of which pliny speaks for the horses skull our people have substituted an eggshell on the top of a switch stuck among the cabbages it is easier to arrange also it is quite as useful that is to say it has no effect whatever everything even the nonsensical is capable of explanation with a little credulity when i question the peasants our neighbours they tell me that the effect of the eggshell is as simple as can be the butterflies attracted by the whiteness come and lay their eggs on it broiled by the sun and lacking all nourishment on that thankless support the little caterpillars die and that makes so many fewer i insist i ask them if they have ever seen slabs of eggs or masses of young caterpillars on those white shells never they reply with one voice well then it was done in the old days and so we go on doing it thats all we know and thats enough for us i leave it at that persuaded that the memory of the horses skull used once upon a time is ineradicable like all the rustic absurdities implanted by the ages we have when all is said but one means of protection which is to watch and inspect the cabbageleaves assiduously and crush the slabs of eggs between our finger and thumb and the caterpillars with our feet nothing is so effective as this method which makes great demands on ones time and vigilance what pains to obtain an unspoilt cabbage and what a debt do we not owe to those humble scrapers of the soil those ragged heroes who provide us with the wherewithal to live to eat and digest to accumulate reserves whence the butterfly will issue that is the caterpillars one and only business the cabbagecaterpillar performs it with insatiable gluttony incessantly it browses incessantly digests the supreme felicity of an animal which is little more than an intestine there is never a distraction unless it be certain seesaw movements which are particularly curious when several caterpillars are grazing side by side abreast then at intervals all the heads in the row are briskly lifted and as briskly lowered time after time with an automatic precision worthy of a prussian drillground can it be their method of intimidating an always possible aggressor can it be a manifestation of gaiety when the wanton sun warms their full paunches whether sign of fear or sign of bliss this is the only exercise that the gluttons allow themselves until the proper degree of plumpness is attained after a months grazing the voracious appetite of my caged herd is assuaged the caterpillars climb the trelliswork in every direction walk about anyhow with their forepart raised and searching space here and there as they pass the swaying herd put forth a thread they wander restlessly anxiously to travel afar the exodus now prevented by the trellised enclosure i once saw under excellent conditions at the advent of the cold weather i had placed a few cabbagestalks covered with caterpillars in a small greenhouse those who saw the common kitchen vegetable sumptuously lodged under glass in the company of the pelargonium and the chinese primrose were astonished at my curious fancy i let them smile i had my plans i wanted to find out how the family of the large white butterfly behaves when the cold weather sets in things happened just as i wished at the end of november the caterpillars having grown to the desired extent left the cabbages one by one and began to roam about the walls none of them fixed himself there or made preparations for the transformation i suspected that they wanted the choice of a spot in the open air exposed to all the rigours of winter i therefore left the door of the hothouse open soon the whole crowd had disappeared i found them dispersed all over the neighbouring walls some thirty yards off the thrust of a ledge the eaves formed by a projecting bit of mortar served them as a shelter where the chrysalid moult took place and where the winter was passed the cabbagecaterpillar possesses a robust constitution unsusceptible to torrid heat or icy cold all that he needs for his metamorphosis is an airy lodging free from permanent damp the inmates of my fold therefore move about for a few days on the trelliswork anxious to travel afar in search of a wall finding none and realizing that time presses they resign themselves each one supporting himself on the trellis first weaves around himself a thin carpet of white silk which will form the sustaining layer at the time of the laborious and delicate work of the nymphosis he fixes his rearend to this base by a silk pad and his forepart by a strap that passes under his shoulders and is fixed on either side to the carpet thus slung from his three fastenings he strips himself of his larval apparel and turns into a chrysalis in the open air with no protection save that of the wall which the caterpillar would certainly have found had i not interfered of a surety he would be shortsighted indeed that pictured a world of good things prepared exclusively for our advantage the earth the great fostermother has a generous breast at the very moment when nourishing matter is created even though it be with our own zealous aid she summons to the feast host upon host of consumers who are all the more numerous and enterprising in proportion as the table is more amply spread the cherry of our orchards is excellent eating a maggot contends with us for its possession in vain do we weigh suns and planets our supremacy which fathoms the universe cannot prevent a wretched worm from levying its toll on the delicious fruit we make ourselves at home in a cabbagebed the sons of the pieris make themselves at home there too preferring broccoli to wild radish they profit where we have profited and we have no remedy against their competition save caterpillarraids and eggcrushing a thankless tedious and none too efficacious work every creature has its claims on life the cabbagecaterpillar eagerly puts forth his own so much so that the cultivation of the precious plant would be endangered if others concerned did not take part in its defence these others are the auxiliaries 48 our helpers from necessity and not from sympathy the words friend and foe auxiliaries and ravagers are here the mere conventions of a language not always adapted to render the exact truth he is our foe who eats or attacks our crops our friend is he who feeds upon our foes everything is reduced to a frenzied contest of appetites in the name of the might that is mine of trickery of highway robbery clear out of that you and make room for me give me your seat at the banquet that is the inexorable law in the world of animals and more or less alas in our own world as well now among our entomological auxiliaries the smallest in size are the best at their work one of them is charged with watching over the cabbages she is so small she works so discreetly that the gardener does not know her has not even heard of her were he to see her by accident flitting around the plant which she protects he would take no notice of her would not suspect the service rendered i propose to set forth the tiny midgets deserts scientists call her microgaster glomeratus what exactly was in the mind of the author of the name microgaster which means little belly did he intend to allude to the insignificance of the abdomen not so however slight the belly may be the insect nevertheless possesses one correctly proportioned to the rest of the body so that the classic denomination far from giving us any information might mislead us were we to trust it wholly nomenclature which changes from day to day and becomes more and more cacophonous is an unsafe guide instead of asking the animal what its name is let us begin by asking what can you do what is your business well the microgasters business is to exploit the cabbagecaterpillar a clearlydefined business admitting of no possible confusion would we behold her works in the spring let us inspect the neighbourhood of the kitchengarden be our eye never so unobservant we shall notice against the walls or on the withered grasses at the foot of the hedges some very small yellow cocoons heaped into masses the size of a hazelnut beside each group lies a cabbagecaterpillar sometimes dying sometimes dead and always presenting a most tattered appearance these cocoons are the work of the microgasters family hatched or on the point of hatching into the perfect stage the caterpillar is the dish whereon that family has fed during its larval state the epithet glomeratus which accompanies the name of microgaster suggests this conglomeration of cocoons let us collect the clusters as they are without seeking to separate them an operation which would demand both patience and dexterity for the cocoons are closely united by the inextricable tangle of their surfacethreads in may a swarm of pigmies will sally forth ready to get to business in the cabbages colloquial language uses the terms midge and gnat to describe the tiny insects which we often see dancing in a ray of sunlight there is something of everything in those aerial ballets it is possible that the persecutrix of the cabbagecaterpillar is there along with many another but the name of midge cannot properly be applied to her he who says midge says fly dipteron twowinged insect and our friend has four wings one and all adapted for flying by virtue of this characteristic and others no less important she belongs to the order of hymenoptera 49 no matter as our language possesses no more precise term outside the scientific vocabulary let us use the expression midge which pretty well conveys the general idea our midge the microgaster is the size of an average gnat she measures 3 or 4 millimetres 50 the two sexes are equally numerous and wear the same costume a black uniform all but the legs which are pale red in spite of this likeness they are easily distinguished the male has an abdomen which is slightly flattened and moreover curved at the tip the female before the laying has hers full and perceptibly distended by its ovular contents this rapid sketch of the insect should be enough for our purpose if we wish to know the grub and especially to inform ourselves of its manner of living it is advisable to rear in a cage a numerous herd of cabbagecaterpillars whereas a direct search on the cabbages in our garden would give us but a difficult and uncertain harvest by this means we shall daily have as many as we wish before our eyes in the course of june which is the time when the caterpillars quit their pastures and go far afield to settle on some wall or other those in my fold finding nothing better climb to the dome of the cage to make their preparations and to spin a supporting network for the chrysalids needs among these spinners we see some weaklings working listlessly at their carpet their appearance makes us deem them in the grip of a mortal disease i take a few of them and open their bellies using a needle by way of a scalpel what comes out is a bunch of green entrails soaked in a bright yellow fluid which is really the creatures blood these tangled intestines swarm with little lazy grubs varying greatly in number from ten or twenty at least to sometimes halfahundred they are the offspring of the microgaster what do they feed on the lens makes conscientious enquiries nowhere does it manage to show me the vermin attacking solid nourishment fatty tissues muscles or other parts nowhere do i see them bite gnaw or dissect the following experiment will tell us more fully i pour into a watchglass the crowds extracted from the hospitable paunches i flood them with caterpillars blood obtained by simple pricks i place the preparation under a glass belljar in a moist atmosphere to prevent evaporation i repeat the nourishing bath by means of fresh bleedings and give them the stimulant which they would have gained from the living caterpillar thanks to these precautions my charges have all the appearance of excellent health they drink and thrive but this state of things cannot last long soon ripe for the transformation my grubs leave the diningroom of the watchglass as they would have left the caterpillars belly they come to the ground to try and weave their tiny cocoons they fail in the attempt and perish they have missed a suitable support that is to say the silky carpet provided by the dying caterpillar no matter i have seen enough to convince me the larvae of the microgaster do not eat in the strict sense of the word they live on soup and that soup is the caterpillars blood examine the parasites closely and you shall see that their diet is bound to be a liquid one they are little white grubs neatly segmented with a pointed forepart splashed with tiny black marks as though the atom had been slaking its thirst in a drop of ink it moves its hindquarters slowly without shifting its position i place it under the microscope the mouth is a pore devoid of any apparatus for disintegrationwork it has no fangs no horny nippers no mandibles its attack is just a kiss it does not chew it sucks it takes discreet sips at the moisture all around it the fact that it refrains entirely from biting is confirmed by my autopsy of the stricken caterpillars in the patients belly notwithstanding the number of nurselings who hardly leave room for the nurses entrails everything is in perfect order nowhere do we see a trace of mutilation nor does aught on the outside betray any havoc within the exploited caterpillars graze and move about peacefully giving no sign of pain it is impossible for me to distinguish them from the unscathed ones in respect of appetite and untroubled digestion when the time approaches to weave the carpet for the support of the chrysalis an appearance of emaciation at last points to the evil that is at their vitals they spin nevertheless they are stoics who do not forget their duty in the hour of death at last they expire quite softly not of any wounds but of anæmia even as a lamp goes out when the oil comes to an end and it has to be the living caterpillar capable of feeding itself and forming blood is a necessity for the welfare of the grubs it has to last about a month until the microgasters offspring have achieved their full growth the two calendars synchronize in a remarkable way when the caterpillar leaves off eating and makes its preparations for the metamorphosis the parasites are ripe for the exodus the bottle dries up when the drinkers cease to need it but until that moment it must remain more or less wellfilled although becoming limper daily it is important therefore that the caterpillars existence be not endangered by wounds which even though very tiny would stop the working of the bloodfountains with this intent the drainers of the bottle are in a manner of speaking muzzled they have by way of a mouth a pore that sucks without bruising the dying caterpillar continues to lay the silk of his carpet with a slow oscillation of the head the moment now comes for the parasites to emerge this happens in june and generally at nightfall a breach is made on the ventral surface or else in the sides never on the back one breach only contrived at a point of minor resistance at the junction of two segments for it is bound to be a toilsome business in the absence of a set of filingtools perhaps the worms take one anothers places at the point attacked and come by turns to work at it with a kiss in one short spell the whole tribe issues through this single opening and is soon wriggling about perched on the surface of the caterpillar the lens cannot perceive the hole which closes on the instant there is not even a hæmorrhage the bottle has been drained too thoroughly you must press it between your fingers to squeeze out a few drops of moisture and thus discover the spot of exit around the caterpillar who is not always quite dead and who sometimes even goes on weaving his carpet a moment longer the vermin at once begin to work at their cocoons the strawcoloured thread drawn from the silkglands by a backward jerk of the head is first fixed to the white network of the caterpillar and then produces adjacent warpbeams so that by mutual entanglements the individual works are welded together and form an agglomeration in which each of the worms has its own cabin for the moment what is woven is not the real cocoon but a general scaffolding which will facilitate the construction of the separate shells all these frames rest upon those adjoining and mixing up their threads become a common edifice wherein each grub contrives a shelter for itself here at last the real cocoon is spun a pretty little piece of closelywoven work in my rearingjars i obtain as many groups of those tiny shells as my future experiments can wish for threefourths of the caterpillars have supplied me with them so ruthless has been the toll of the spring births i lodge these groups one by one in separate glass tubes thus forming a collection on which i can draw at will while in view of my experiments i keep under observation the whole swarm produced by one caterpillar the adult microgaster appears a fortnight later in the middle of june there are fifty in the first tube examined the riotous multitude is in the full enjoyment of the pairingseason for the two sexes always figure among the guests of any one caterpillar what animation what an orgy of love the carnival of those pigmies bewilders the observer and makes his head swim most of the females wishful of liberty plunge down to the waist between the glass of the tube and the plug of cottonwool that closes the end turned to the light but the lower halves remain free and form a circular gallery in front of which the males hustle one another take one anothers places and hastily operate each bides his turn each attends to his little matters for a few moments and then makes way for his rivals and goes off to start again elsewhere the turbulent wedding lasts all the morning and begins afresh next day a mighty throng of couples embracing separating and embracing once more there is every reason to believe that in gardens the mated ones finding themselves in isolated couples would keep quieter here in the tube things degenerate into a riot because the assembly is too numerous for the narrow space what is lacking to complete its happiness apparently a little food a few sugary mouthfuls extracted from the flowers i serve up some provisions in the tubes not drops of honey in which the puny creatures would get stuck but little strips of paper spread with that dainty they come to them take their stand on them and refresh themselves the fare appears to agree with them with this diet renewed as the strips dry up i can keep them in very good condition until the end of my inquisition there is another arrangement to be made the colonists in my spare tubes are restless and quick of flight they will have to be transferred presently to sundry vessels without my risking the loss of a good number or even the whole lot a loss which my hands my forceps and other means of coercion would be unable to prevent by checking the nimble movements of the tiny prisoners the irresistible attraction of the sunlight comes to my aid if i lay one of my tubes horizontally on the table turning one end towards the full light of a sunny window the captives at once make for this brighter end and play about there for a long while without seeking to retreat if i turn the tube in the opposite direction the crowd immediately shifts its quarters and collects at the other end the brilliant sunlight is its great joy with this bait i can send it whithersoever i please we will therefore place the new receptacle jar or testtube on the table pointing the closed end towards the window at its mouth we open one of the full tubes no other precaution is needed even though the mouth leaves a large interval free the swarm hastens into the lighted chamber all that remains to be done is to close the apparatus before moving it the observer is now in control of the multitude without appreciable losses and is able to question it at will we will begin by asking how do you manage to lodge your germs inside the caterpillar this question and others of the same category which ought to take precedence of everything else are generally neglected by the impaler of insects who cares more for the niceties of nomenclature than for glorious realities he classifies his subjects dividing them into regiments with barbarous labels a work which seems to him the highest expression of entomological science names nothing but names the rest hardly counts the persecutor of the pieris used to be called microgaster that is to say little belly today she is called apantales that is to say the incomplete what a fine step forward we now know all about it can our friend at least tell us how the little belly or the incomplete gets into the caterpillar not a bit of it a book which judging by its recent date should be the faithful echo of our actual knowledge informs us that the microgaster inserts her eggs direct into the caterpillars body it goes on to say that the parasitic vermin inhabit the chrysalis whence they make their way out by perforating the stout horny wrapper hundreds of times have i witnessed the exodus of the grubs ripe for weaving their cocoons and the exit has always been made through the skin of the caterpillar and never through the armour of the chrysalis the fact that its mouth is a mere clinging pore deprived of any offensive weapon would even lead me to believe that the grub is incapable of perforating the chrysalids covering this proved error makes me doubt the other proposition though logical after all and agreeing with the methods followed by a host of parasites no matter my faith in what i read in print is of the slightest i prefer to go straight to facts before making a statement of any kind i want to see what i call seeing it is a slower and more laborious process but it is certainly much safer i will not undertake to lie in wait for what takes place on the cabbages in the garden that method is too uncertain and besides does not lend itself to precise observation as i have in hand the necessary materials to wit my collection of tubes swarming with the parasites newly hatched into the adult form i will operate on the little table in my animals laboratory a jar with a capacity of about a litre 51 is placed on the table with the bottom turned towards the window in the sun i put into it a cabbageleaf covered with caterpillars sometimes fully developed sometimes halfway sometimes just out of the egg a strip of honeyed paper will serve the microgaster as a diningroom if the experiment is destined to take some time lastly by the method of transfer which i described above i send the inmates of one of my tubes into the apparatus once the jar is closed there is nothing left to do but to let things take their course and to keep an assiduous watch for days and weeks if need be nothing worth remarking can escape me the caterpillars graze placidly heedless of their terrible attendants if some giddypates in the turbulent swarm pass over the caterpillars spines these draw up their forepart with a jerk and as suddenly lower it again and that is all the intruders forthwith decamp nor do the latter seem to contemplate any harm they refresh themselves on the honeysmeared strip they come and go tumultuously their short flights may land them now in one place now in another on the browsing herd but they pay no attention to it what we see is casual meetings not deliberate encounters in vain i change the flock of caterpillars and vary their age in vain i change the squad of parasites in vain i follow events in the jar for long hours morning and evening both in a dim light and in the full glare of the sun i succeed in seeing nothing absolutely nothing on the parasites side that resembles an attack no matter what the illinformed authors sayillinformed because they had not the patience to see for themselvesthe conclusion at which i arrive is positive to inject the germs the microgaster never attacks the caterpillars the invasion therefore is necessarily effected through the butterflys eggs themselves as experiment will prove my broad jar would tell against the inspection of the troop kept at too great a distance by the glass enclosure and i therefore select a tube an inch wide i place in this a shred of cabbageleaf bearing a slab of eggs as laid by the butterfly i next introduce the inmates of one of my spare vessels a strip of paper smeared with honey accompanies the new arrivals this happens early in july soon the females are there fussing about sometimes to the extent of blackening the whole slab of yellow eggs they inspect the treasure flutter their wings and brush their hindlegs against each other a sign of keen satisfaction they sound the heap probe the interstices with their antennae and tap the individual eggs with their palpi then this one here that one there they quickly apply the tip of their abdomen to the egg selected each time we see a slender horny prickle darting from the ventral surface close to the end this is the instrument that deposits the germ under the film of the egg it is the inoculationneedle the operation is performed calmly and methodically even when several mothers are working at one and the same time where one has been a second goes followed by a third a fourth and others yet nor am i able definitely to see the end of the visits paid to the same egg each time the needle enters and inserts a germ it is impossible in such a crowd for the eye to follow the successive mothers who hasten to lay in each but there is one quite practicable method by which we can estimate the number of germs introduced into a single egg which is later to open the ravaged caterpillars and count the worms which they contain a less repugnant means is to number the little cocoons heaped up around each dead caterpillar the total will tell us how many germs were injected some by the same mother returning several times to the egg already treated others by different mothers well the number of these cocoons varies greatly generally it fluctuates in the neighbourhood of twenty but i have come across as many as sixtyfive and nothing tells me that this is the extreme limit what hideous industry for the extermination of a butterflys progeny i am fortunate at this moment in having a highlycultured visitor versed in the profundities of philosophic thought i make way for him before the apparatus wherein the microgaster is at work for an hour and more standing lens in hand he in his turn looks and sees what i have just seen he watches the layers who go from one egg to the other make their choice draw their slender lancet and prick what the stream of passersby one after the other have already pricked thoughtful and a little uneasy he puts down his lens at last never had he been vouchsafed so clear a glimpse as here in my fingerwide tube of the masterly brigandage that runs through all life down to that of the very smallest '"
