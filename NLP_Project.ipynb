              "'what uncle paul proposes to talk about in these talk that we shall have together said uncle paul a he sat with his nephew one evening in may under the big elder tree in the garden i propose to designate a friend those form of animal life that though not domesticated or cared for by u nevertheless come to our aid by waging war on insect and various other devouring creature which would in the end unless their excessive multiplication were kept in restraint by others besides ourselves eat up all our crop and lay waste our field and it is these ravagers of the farmer carefully tilled acre that i shall speak of a foe what can man effort avail against those voracious horde multiplying a they do every year to an extent beyond calculation will he have the patience the skill the keenness of vision necessary for waging successful warfare on the tiniest specie often the most formidable when the junebug despite it far greater size baffle all his endeavor will he undertake to examine his field and inspect every lump of soil every spear of wheat every separate leaf on his fruittrees for so prodigious a task the whole human race would be inadequate even if it united all it effort to this one end the devouring horde would reduce u to starvation my child had we not able helper to work for u helper endowed with a patience that nothing can tire a skill that foil all rus a vigilance that nothing escape to lie in ambush for the enemy to track it to it remotest retreat to hunt it unceasingly and finally to exterminate itthat is their sole care their neverending occupation urged on by the pang of hunger they are relentless in their pursuit both for their own sake and on behalf of their progeny they live on those that live on u they are the enemy of our enemy engaged in this work are the martin that just at present are circling over our head the bat that fly around our house the owl that call to one another from the hollow willow trunk in the meadow the warbler that sing in the grove the frog that croak in the ditch and many more besides including the toad which is an object of loathing to most people thanks be to god who ha given u to serve a guardian of our daily bread the owl and the toad the bat and the viper the frog and the lizard all these creature wrongfully cursed and shamefully abused by u and foolishly looked upon with repugnance and hatred in reality lend u valiant assistance and should take a high place in our esteem to repair the injustice they have suffered shall be my first duty a we come to each of them in turn thanks be to god who to protect u from that great eater the insect ha given u the swallow and the warbler the robin redbreast and the nightingale these the delight of our eye and ear creature of infinite gracemust i again raise my voice in their defense ala yes for their home are ravaged by the barbarous nesthunter it is my purpose now to acquaint you my child with these various helper of man in his labor a tiller of the soil i will tell you about their way of living their habit and their aptitude and the service they render u my object will be attained if i succeed in imparting to you a little of the interest they deserve i will begin with those that have teeth but first let u take a glance at the shape and structure of teeth in general for it is this that determines the kind of food required by the animal teeth is it not true resumed uncle paul that each kind of work demand it own special tool the plowman must have the plow the blacksmith the anvil the mason the trowel the weaver the shuttle the carpenter the plane and these different tool all excellent for the work to which they are applied would be of no use in any other could the mason roughcast his wall with a shuttle could the weaver weave his cloth with a trowel evidently not is it not true then that from the tool one may easily guess the kind of work it doe nothing could be easier it seems to me replied jules if i see plane and saw hanging on the wall i know that i am in a carpenter shop and i should know said emile from seeing an anvil a hammer and a pair of tongs that i wa in a blacksmith shop but if i saw a mortarboard and a trowel i should look around for the mason well uncle paul went on every creature ha it special task in creation great workshop where all take part all work according to the design of divine wisdom each specie ha it missioni might say it trade to followa trade that requires special tool just a doe any work done by man now among the innumerable trade of animal there is one that is common to all without exception the most important trade of all a without it life itself would be impossible it is the business of eating but all animal do not take the same kind of food some need prey raw flesh others fodder some eat root others seed and fruit in every instance teeth are the tool used in the work of eating so they must have the shape appropriate to the kind of food eaten whether that be tough or tender hard or easy to chew therefore just a from his tool the artisan work may be inferred so from the shape of it teeth one can usually tell the kind of food eaten by any animal herbivorous animal are those that live on grass fodder hay and carnivorous animal are those that eat flesh the horse the donkey the ox and the sheep are herbivorous the dog the cat and the wolf carnivorous the food of the herbivorous animal is tough hard fibrous and must be ground for a long time by the teeth in order to be reduced to a pastelike mass suitable for swallowing and after that for easy digestion in this case the teeth in both upper and lower jaw must have broad and almost flat surface that will come together and grind the food a millstone grind grain on the other hand the flesh eaten by the carnivorous animal is soft easy to swallow and easy to digest all that the animal ha to do is to tear it apart and cut it into shred so the teeth here must have sharp edge that come together and operate like the blade of a pair of scissors i think i have said enough on that subject now which of you will tell me what kind of food go with each of the teeth i show you here and uncle paul laid before his hearer the two teeth pictured on these page with others to follow the first tooth said emile is flattened and very wide at the top it must crush and grind by rubbing against a tooth of the same kind in the opposite jaw so it is the tooth of an animal that eats fodder it is indeed uncle paul replied the tooth of an herbivorous animal a horse the second continued emile is composed of several broad point with edge almost a sharp a knife blade it must be meant for cutting flesh those winding fold that you see in the horse toothwhat are they for asked jules there is nothing like them in the wolf tooth i wa going to tell you about them his uncle replied if the horse teeth had perfectly smooth surface without any roughness to act a a grater is it not true that in pressing and rubbing each against the opposite tooth they would simply crush the fodder or hay a you would crush it between two smooth stone without changing it into fine powder millstone if they were polished like marble table would flatten the grain without making flour of it they must be rough on the surface in order to seize the wheat during the grinding of the upper stone on the stationary lower one and to make it into powder when by long use the surface is worn smooth the stone are of no service until they are dented again with the hammer well the fold of a horse teeth may be likened to the roughness of a millstone they project a little above the general surface of the tooth making a sort of coarse file that tear to piece blade of grass or hay when rubbed by the opposite tooth i think i see a danger threatening the herbivorous animal put in jules at this point those projecting fold must soon be worn down by rubbing against one another just the same a the roughness on the millstone if smooth millstone cant make flour without being roughened again no more can the herbivorous animal worn teeth go on grinding that is provided for admirably provided for my boy everything in the world is arranged so that it can do it work a wisdom that nothing escape watch over the smallest detail everything even to a donkey jaw show this to be so listen and judge for yourselves there are two different substance in a tooth one very hard a little like glass and called enamel the other quicker to wear out but very difficult to break and known a ivory these two substance are combined in different way according to the animal diet in the horse the sheep the ox the donkey and many other herbivorous animal the ivory make up the main part of the tooth while the harder substance the enamel extends in winding sheet throughout the former projecting a little above it surface in a fold which varies in form in the different kind of animal so then it is the enamel a substance a hard a a pebble that composes the fold in the herbivorous animal teeth from the rubbing of the lower teeth against the upper the ivory wear away faster than the enamel so that the fold of the latter embedded in the mass of the tooth have their cutting edge brought above the general level a fast a required and thus the grinding surface are kept in constant repair you see how it is in the donkey foodmill for instance the millstone reroughen themselves a fast a necessary for the chewing of a thistle the machinery is selfrepairing even while at work what you tell u uncle is wonderful commented jules i never should have guessed that such an arrangement wa necessary for chewing a thistle and only the other day put in louis i kicked out of my way a jawbone that wa lying in the road how gladly should i have looked at it closely if i had known all these thing ignorance always kick thing aside like that my boy but science is interested in everything knowing that it can always learn something but let u return to the teeth of the carnivorous animal and examine those of the wolf here the irregularity of the nutmeggrater the parallel ridge of the file and the roughness of the millstone would be of no use since the animal food is to be torn into shred and not chewed into paste for the wolf food cutting blade are neededsharp scissors which are hard enough not to become blunt hence the working edge of the wolf teeth are not flat like millstone but shaped rather like pointed chisel the ivory form the central body of the tooth making it tough and strong while the enamel harder but more brittle is spread a a continuous layer over the tooth and furnishes the requisite cutting edge in like manner a skilful cutler when he wish to make an edged tool that will cut well and at the same time withstand violent blow make it central mass of iron a tough material that bear considerable violence without injury but is not hard enough to furnish a keen cutting edge he then overlay it to obtain such an edge with fine steel which combine excessive hardness with the fragility of glass the best that man can contrive in the making of edged tool is met with in perfection in the teeth of carnivorous animal if i understand you then said jules ivory which is not so hard a enamel but le brittle form the interior of the teeth of carnivorous animal and enamel which is harder and more brittle form the outside layer ivory make the teeth strong enamel make them cut yes that is it now i dont know which is the more wonderful the donkey or the wolf set of teeth both are wonderful a both are admirably adapted to the kind of work they have to do what surprise me most emile interposed is that a lot of thing we should never pay any attention to turn out to be very interesting when uncle paul explains them to u i never should have thought that the time would come when i should listen with pleasure to the history of a tooth since that interest you said uncle paul i will continue the subject a little further and will tell you about human teeth about yours my boy so white and so well arranged and so admirably adapted for biting a slice of bread and butter the different shape of teeth man ha thirtytwo teeth sixteen to each jaw uncle paul continued emile already had his finger in his mouth passing it from one tooth to another to count them his uncle paused until he had finished the count but i have only twenty all told declared the boy twenty and not thirtytwo the other twelve will come some day my boy at present you have the right number of teeth for a child of your age they do not all come at one time but one after another we begin with twenty and no more they are called milk teeth or first teeth when we are about seven year old they begin to fall out and are replaced by others stronger and set in more firmly in addition to this second score of teeth there appear later twelve others bringing the total number up to thirtytwo those farthest back in the inmost cavity of the mouth come late when we are eighteen or twenty year old or even older for which reason they are called wisdom teeth to signify that they appear at an age when the reason is well developed these thirtytwo last teeth constitute the second cutting i call them last because they are never replaced by any others if we lose them that is the end of our teeth no more will come i have two now that are loose said emile they must come out soon to leave room for the new teeth that are to take their place the others will get loose too and the twenty that you have now will be succeeded by twenty others to which sooner or later will be added twelve more which come only once these last occupy the back part of the jaw three on each side top and bottom thus the final number will be thirtytwo these thirtytwo teeth are divided into three class according to their shape and the work they must do the same name being repeated top and bottom and right and left i show you merely the eight teeth of half a jaw in every tooth there are two part to be distinguished the crown and the root the root is the part that is embedded in the jawbone like a nail hammered into wood the crown is the part that come into view and it may be likened to the head of a nail the root hold the tooth in place fix it firmly the crown cut tear and grind the food in the two front teeth in each halfjaw the crown grows thinner toward the top the edge is straight and sharp fitted for cutting food dividing it into small mouthful therefore these teeth are called incisor from the latin incidere meaning to cut their root is a simple pivot the next tooth is called canine it root is a little longer than those of the preceding teeth and it crown is slightly pointed the dog the cat the wolf and carnivorous animal in general have this tooth shaped like a powerful fang which serf to catch and hold prey but above all act a a weapon in attack and defense it is the canine teeth that you see crossing one another long and pointed two on each side when you raise the upper lip of a cat or a dog because of these remarkable fang of carnivorous animal especially the dog which in latin is canis the name canine ha been given to the teeth that in man are like them if not in form and use at least in the position they occupy the next five teeth are the most useful of all they are called molar from the latin mola a millstone because they play the part of millstone in grinding the food for this purpose their crown are blunt and broad and slightly irregular not flat like the horse molar or with sharp cutting edge like the wolf because man food is not composed exclusively of either vegetable or flesh but of both at the same time for food a varied a man there is need of molar fit for all sort of service they must grind like those of the herbivorous animal and cut like those of the carnivorous in short they must be like those of both and indeed their wide crown are suited to vegetable food and their rather sharp irregularity are adapted to animal food the first two are called little molar or in more learned language bicuspid because they have each two cusp or point they are the least strong of the five and have only one root each the two little molar the canine tooth and the two incisor of each halfjaw are the only teeth that are renewed multiply them by four and you will have the twenty teeth of the first cutting teeth that begin to fall out toward the age of seven and are gradually replaced by others that is the state of emile teeth at present there being but twenty of them the other three teeth in each halfjaw come only once they are the large molar of which the very end one is also called the wisdom tooth a in the act of mastication the large molar have to bear strong pressure the root is composed of several pivot or prong reaching down each into a special cavity or socket this make them strong and firm so that they can stand pressure both downward and sideways to sum up the grown man ha thirtytwo teeth in all sixteen to each jaw namely four incisor two canine and ten molar these last are divided into four bicuspid or little molar and six large molar the milk teeth do not include these last six here jules had a question to ask ivory and enamel said he those two substance of different degree of hardness that you told u were arranged in such a wonderful way in horse and wolf teethare they in our teeth too yes they are there ivory form the entire root which must serve a a firm support and it also fill the crown while enamel merely cover the outside a a hard protecting layer i am going to get the cat and look at her teeth said emile ha she twenty like me or ha she thirtytwo neither twenty nor thirtytwo but thirty when fullgrown dog and wolf have fortytwo horse and donkey fortyfour in fact the number varies with different animal a much a the shape perhaps a few word on this subject will not be out of place first here is the picture of a wolf mouth if one did not already know one could easily guess the animal diet by merely looking at it teeth those deeply indented molar those strong curved caninessurely they call for wild prey and show great strength the whole set indicates clearly enough a carnivorous appetite at i are the incisor six in number they are small and of slight use for the animal doe not cut it prey into little mouthful but swallow it gluttonously in great strip at c are the canine veritable dagger which the bandit plunge into the sheep neck the little molar are at m the large molar come next the first marked r is the strongest and it is with this that the wolf and the dog crack the hardest bone finally the picture show the salivary gland that is the organ that prepare the saliva and let it ooze into the mouth through the canal s a the animal eats without dwelling on this point which would take me too far from my subject i will merely say that saliva serf to soak the food and make a soft mouthful that can be easily swallowed and it also play an important part in the stomach in reducing to a fluid pap the food taken in that is to say it help to digest the food let u pas on to the cat another typical flesheater six small incisor are ranged in the front of the jaw like a row of elegant but useless pearl they are ornamental rather than useful to the animal a mousehunter need very long and pointed canine for piercing the prey seized by the claw in this respect the cat is armed in a very formidable manner what do you think of it louis i think he replied a rat must be very uncomfortable between those curved canine the picture show u one day said emile when i wa pulling the cat mustache she gave me a bite that felt like the sharp prick of a needle it wa done so quickly i had no time to draw my hand back the cat brought her canine into play and wounded you with one of them a quickly a a steel point could have done now look at the molar there are four above the last one very small and three below their cusp or point are still sharper than the wolf so too the cat appetitelike that of it kindred the tiger the panther the jaguar and othersdemands more flesh than that of the wolf and animal like it such a the fox the jackal and especially the dog have you ever noticed how disdainful the cat is when you throw her only a piece of bread scarcely ha she smelt it when she make a movement of superb scorn tail in the air back raised and look at you a if to say are you making fun of me i want something else or if very hungry she reluctantly bite the bread chew it awkwardly and swallow it with distaste the dog on the contrary our good azor for example catch the bread joyfully in his mouth without letting it touch the ground and if he find any fault with the piece it is for being too small you call the cat a glutton i take her part and maintain that it is not the vice of gluttony she show but that her teeth must have meat what could you expect her pointed canine and keenedged molar to do with a crust of bread they demand above all a prey that bleeds a quivering bit of flesh what a difference between the teeth of the hunter and those of the peaceful chewer of grass let u examine this picture of a horse head here the incisor six in number are powerful they seize the forage and cut it a mouthful at a time the canine of no use here show only a little knob on the jawbone next beyond come a long vacant space called the bar that is where the bit is held in the horse mouth back of the bar you see the real grinding mechanism composed of twelve pair of strong molar with square flat crown furnished with slightly projecting fold whose usefulness i have already pointed out to you if i am not much mistaken here we have a mill capable of grinding tough straw and fibrous hay finally here is a rabbit head each jaw is furnished with two enormous incisor set deep into the bone bent backward above and ending each in a sharpedged crown what are such incisor a those made for i know jules quickly replied the rabbit is always nibbling for want of better food it will gnaw the bark of a tree and even the wood it us it incisor to cut it food very fine to gnaw it to gnaw itthat is the right word hence we give the name of rodent or gnawer to the various animal having incisor of that kind such are the squirrel the hare the rabbit the rat and the mouse those poor creature which must gnaw the toughest vegetable substance and fill their belly with wood paper rag even when there is nothing better for supplying the mill that is kept always going but it is not merely to satisfy their hunger that these animal are almost incessantly gnawing there is another reason for their doing it their incisor grow all their life and tend to lengthen indefinitely consequently the animal must wear them away by continual friction a otherwise their crown would at last so far overlap that they could not be made to meet then the poor beast would be unable to seize it food and would perish in order to be able to eat when hungry the rat and the rabbit must eat when not hungry so a to sharpen their incisor and keep them the right length it is true that they often turn their attention to very poor fodder a splinter of wood a straw a mere nothing suffices to maintain the play of their indefatigable incisor remember child the expressive term rodent which mean gnawer applied to a whole class of animal akin to the rabbit and the rat remember their curious incisor for we shall have occasion to speak of them again hereafter for the present let u finish our examination of the rabbit teeth the canine are lacking in their place the jaw show a bar or in other word a large open space at the extreme back of the mouth are the molar few in number but strong with flat crown and several fold of enamel in fact they make an excellent grinding machine in giving you these detail concerning the different shape of teeth in different specie of animal i wished particularly to point out the following truth each specie eats a particular kind of food for which the teeth are especially formed so that one might say of any animal show me it teeth and i will tell you what it eats in many instance where we can not examine the teeth we do not know what such and such a creature feed on and in our hasty judgment we mistake a friend for an enemy a helper for a destroyer if the animal is ugly we condemn it on the spot and hate it accusing it of any number of misdeed we declare war against it and never suspect in our foolishness that it is a war at our own expense but there is a very simple precaution by which we can avoid these regrettable mistake let u yield to no prejudice however widespread and before condemning an animal a harmful let u find out what sort of teeth it ha they will tell u the animal way of living a you shall soon see for yourselves bat which of you three can tell me what bat feed upon asked uncle paul the next day at this question emile put on his thinkingcap closing his eye and rubbing his forehead but no idea came nor were jules and louis any prompter with an answer nobody know well then so much the better for you will have the satisfaction of finding it out for yourselves from the shape of the teeth the incisor small and weak which you see on an enlarged scale in this picture of a bat set of teethdo they look a if they were made for gnawing vegetable substance after the manner of rat and rabbit could they cut any such tough fodder certainly not replied jules they are too weak to be of much use and then it seems to me those two sharp curved fang must belong to a flesheating animal the long pointed canine do indicate a much but the molar show it perhaps still more plainly with their strong and sharp indented crown fitting so well into the sharpedged depression of the opposite jaware those molar designed to crush grain to grind slowly and patiently fibrous substance no said jules they are the teeth of a flesheater not the gristmill of an herbivorous animal i am sure now affirmed louis that the bat life on prey it is a greedy hunter of flesh and blood emile declared the cat teeth are not more savagelooking all that is quite correct said uncle paul the teeth have taught you the chief thing about the animal habit yes the bat is a hunter an eater of live prey a little ogre always demanding fresh meat it only remains to find out the kind of game it like evidently the size of the prey must suit the size of the hunter a bat head is no bigger than a large hazelnut it is true the mouth is split from ear to ear and can when wide open swallow mouthful larger than the smallness of the animal would lead one to suppose nevertheless the bat can attack only small creature what can it be that it go chasing through the air when after sunset it fly hither and thither unceasingly gnat perhaps and nightmoths jules suggested exactly those are it prey the bat life on insect exclusively all are food for it maw hardwinged beetle slender mosquito plump moth flying insect of all sort in fact all the little winged foe of our cereal vine fruittrees woolen stuffsall those creature of the air that come in the evening attracted by our lighted room and singe their wing in the flame of our lamp who would undertake to say how many insect bat destroy when they fly around a house the game is so small and the hunter is so hungry notice what happens on a calm summer evening lured abroad by the balmy atmosphere of the twilight hour a host of insect leave their lurkingplaces and come forth guest at life garden party to sport together in the air hunt for food and mate with one another it is the hour when the sphinxmoths fly abruptly from flower to flower and thrust their long probosces into the depth of the corolla where honey is stored the hour when the mosquito thirsting for human blood sound it warcry in our ear and selects our tenderest spot to stab with it poisoned lancet the hour when the junebug leaf the shelter of the leaf spread it buzzing wing and go humming through the air in quest of it fellow the gnat dance in joyous swarm which the slightest breath of wind disperses like a column of smoke butterfly and moth in weddinggarments their wing powdered with silvery dust and their antennæ spread out like plume join in the frolic or seek place in which to deposit their egg the woodborer come forth from it hidden retreat under the bark of the elm the weevil break it cell hollowed out in a grain of wheat the plumemoths rise in cloud from the granary and fly toward the field of ripe cereal other moth explore here the grapevine there the peartrees appletrees cherrytrees busily seeking food and shelter for their evil progeny but in the midst of these festive assembly suddenly there come a killjoy it is the bat which fly hither and thither up and down appearing and disappearing darting it head out this side and that and each time snapping up an insect on the wing crushing and swallowing it immediately the hunting is good gnat beetle and moth abound and every now and then a little cry of joy announces the capture of a plump junebug a long a the fading twilight permit the eager hunter thus pursues it work of extermination satisfied at last the bat fly back to it somber and quiet retreat the next evening and all through the summer the hunt is resumed always with the same ardor always at the expense of insect only to give you an idea of the multitude of harmful insect especially of moth from which the bat delivers u i will quote a passage from the celebrated french naturalist buffon the most graphic historian of the animal kingdom but first i must tell you that bat are in the habit of making their home in old tower grotto and abandoned quarry there in great number they pas the daylight hour hanging motionless from the roof and thence they sally forth at the approach of darkness the floor of these retreat becomes covered at last with a deep layer of droppings from which we can learn the kind of food eaten by bat and judge of the importance of their hunting now here is what buffon ha to say of a grotto frequented by these creature having one day descended into the grotto of arci i wa surprised to find there a kind of earth of a singular nature it formed a bed of blackish matter several foot thick almost entirely composed of part of the wing and foot of fly and moth a if these insect had gathered here in immense number coming together for the express purpose of dying and rotting in company it wa nothing but bat dung that had been accumulating for year what a curious kind of soil made up entirely of the remains of dead insect jules exclaimed i will add that sometimes this soil of fly and moth at the bottom of old quarry and cave is abundant enough for the farmer to take account of it and use it a a rich fertilizer it is called bat guano to make such heap of it then remarked louis bat must destroy insect by million and million five or six dozen fly or moth are hardly enough for a bat evening meal if a few junebugs should make their appearance they would be eagerly snapped up if the band of hunter is a large one judge of the thousand of harmful insect destroyed in a single season next to the bird we have no more valiant helper than bat and so i beg you to be friendly to these creature which while we are asleep and perhaps dreaming of our rich crop of pear and apple peach and grape and grain proceed with their silent warfare against the enemy of our harvest and every evening destroy by myriad moth mosquito beetle bugsin short the greater part of the insect throng that always threatens u with starvation if we do not keep vigilant watch i see now that the bat doe u a good turn emile admitted all the same it is frightfully ugly and besides they say if it touch you it will give you the itch there are any number of other saying about it that are just a foolish my boy one is that the bat prick with it pointed teeth the shegoats udder so a to suck her blood and milk another is that it gnaws the sausage and bacon hung under the chimney mantel also that it sudden entrance into a house mean misfortune i have heard person cry out because a bat had accidentally grazed them with the tip of it wing and i have seen others pale with terror because they had found one of the innocent creature fastened by a claw to their bed curtain here a in many other thing my dear child you must take into account the folly of mankind which is more given to error than to truth if you were old enough to understand me i should add that wherever i find a general agreement that a thing is black i think it well to look into the matter and find out whether on the contrary it may not be white we are so stuffed with false notion that very often the exact opposite of the common belief is the real truth do you ask for example there are plenty of them the sun we generally say according to all appearance revolves from east to west around the stationary earth no say science no it is the earth on the contrary that rotates from west to east before the stationary sun the star we say again are small bright point little lamp in the arch of the firmament no answer science the star are not tiny spark they are enormous body which compare in light and size to the sun itself a million and a half time a large a the earth the bat it is commonly asserted is a harmful hideous venomous creature of ill omen that must be crushed without mercy under the heel no affirms science a thousand time no the bat is an inoffensive creature that instead of doing u harm and bringing misfortune render u an immense service by protecting the good thing of the earth from their countless destroyer no we should not vent our hatred upon it and pitilessly kill it on the contrary we should like and respect it a one of our best helper the poor creature doe not deserve the bad reputation that ignorance ha given it it touch doe not communicate either louse or the itch it teeth do not pierce the goat udder or attack our store of bacon it chance entrance into a room is no more to be dreaded than a butterfly for my part i should like to have it visit my bedroom often at night for then i should soon be rid of the mosquito that torment me all thing considered we have nothing absolutely nothing to reproach it with and we are indebted to it for very valuable service that is the answer of science to ignorant prejudice henceforth then crush the bat under your heel if you dare i will take good care said louis never to do such a thing now that i know what an army of enemy we are guarded against by the bat but what a pity jules remarked that it is such a hideous creature hideous his uncle repeated that is a slander which i hope to make you take back surely you cant deny that the bat is horribly ugly persisted the boy perhaps i can i should like to know said emile how you can make out that the frightful shape of the creature is beautiful to discus ugliness and beauty with you my child replied uncle paul is not an undertaking that i should care to enter upon to follow me in such a discussion you would need a maturity of mind that doe not go with your year even if you were grown up it might still be impossible for u to come to an agreement inasmuch a it is not with the bodily eye that ugliness and beauty should be judged but with the eye of reason ripened by reflection and study and free from the trammel of first impression which are generally erroneous also how few posse that intellectual clearness of vision that remains untroubled by prematurely conceived opinion and can thus contemplate thing in all the clarity of truth trusting the testimony of our eye and yielding to daily habit we call beautiful the creature whose general structure show a certain conformity with that of the animal most familiar to u and unthinkingly accepted a standard for all future judgment we call ugly those that differ from these accepted model and if very unlike we call them hideous enlightened reason refuse to be hemmed in by the narrow circle of first impression it rise above petty prejudice and say to itself nothing is ugly that god ha made everything is beautiful everything is perfect in itself a everything is the work of the creator an animal form should not be judged by it greater or le resemblance to the form that are already familiar to u and serve u a standard of comparison but rather by it fitness for the kind of life for which it wa created where the structure is in perfect harmony with the function to be performed there too is beauty from this higher point of view ugliness no longer exists or rather it exists all too abundantly but only in the moral world intemperance laziness stupid prideall form of vice in shortconstitute ugliness and hideousness to tell the truth i know of none besides but i must return to the bat if not in the hope of making you find it beautiful at least with the certainty of interesting you in it remarkable structure i will wager too that not one of you know what a bat is it is a kind of bird declared emile it is an old rat that ha grown a pair of wing jules ventured to assert you are both talking nonsense returned their uncle that is the way with u all we speak at random of animal and person giving to one our esteem to another our scorn without knowing what they are what they do what they are good for you dont know the first thing about the bat and yet you overwhelm the poor animal with abuse the bat ha nothing in common with bird it ha neither beak nor feather nor is it a rat that ha acquired wing in it old age it is really a peculiar creature that is born life and dy with wing without in any way belonging to the bird family it body ha the size the fur and somewhat the shape of a mouse but it wing are bare the most highly organized animal have a a distinctive mark teat or udder which furnish milk the first food of their young these animal do not feed their young family from the beak a bird do they do not abandon their offspring to all the hazard of good or ill fortune careless of their future a do the stupid race of reptile and fish the female rear their young with maternal care feeding them from time to time with milk from their udder all the various specie that suckle their young all that are provided with udder are classed together by men of learning and called mammal from the latin mamma a breast or teat i will add that in the great majority of instance these animal have the body covered with fur or hair and not with feather or scale feather belong to bird scale to reptile and fish a example of mammal you will immediately think of our domestic animal the dog the cat the cow the sheep the goat the horse and others i have often noticed said emile how carefully the cat raise her family while the kitten press her teat with their little pink paw to make the milk flow faster the old cat wash them with her tongue and show her happiness by her soft purring well then resumed uncle paul the bat is a mammal just a much a is the cat and like that of the cat it body is protected from the cold by fur and the female ha teat for nursing her little one the number of teat varies widely in the different kind of animal being greater in the specie that have many young at a birth and le in the others which is a it should be in order that the nursling may all be suckled at the same time the bat ha only two situated on the breast and not under the stomach the female bear only a single young one at a time emile rightly admires the love of the cat for her kitten yet the bat is a still tenderer mother when in the evening she go out in search of food instead of leaving her nursling in some hole in the wall after suckling it she carry it with her clinging to her breast and it is while weighted with this load that she chase the nimble moth on the wing doubtless the pursuit of prey is thus rendered le fruitful and more difficult but no matter the loving mother prefers not to abandon her feeble charge and allows it to continue peacefully sucking during the evolution of the hunt with the deepening darkness the bat regains it retreat suspends itself from the roof by a toenail and hold it nursling by wrapping it in her wing that is not so bad a way to behave admitted jules i begin to find the bat le ugly than i thought that is what i just told you returned his uncle ugliness is begotten of ignorance it diminishes a knowledge increase but let u continue our theme the bat wing wing real wing perfectly adapted to flying are the bat most striking feature how can a mammal an animal whose general structure is that of a dog or a cat for example posse the flyingapparatus of a bird how can two organ so entirely different be combined in the bat wing my child we find an admirable example of the infinite resource at the command of the creator who without adding to or subtracting from the fundamental plan ha adapted the same organ to the most widely different function the fore foot of mammalsof the dog or the cat we will sayare changed into wing in the bat without the addition or the loss of a single part in this incredible transformation more than that the human arm our arm childrenare there represented piece by piece bone by bone you all look at me a if you did not believe it unable to understand how there can be anything in common between our arm and a bat wing the fact is jules confessed it take all my faith in your word to make me admit that there can be the least likeness between a man arm and a bat wing i do not propose to make you admit it because of your faith in me i propose to prove it to you follow along your arm so a to grasp the demonstration better from the shoulder to the elbow the framework of the human arm consists of a bone known a the humerus from the elbow to the wrist there are two bone of unequal size running side by side the whole length the larger is the cubitus the smaller the radius then come the wrist composed of several little bone which i will not now describe next is the palm of the hand it framework formed of a row of five bone almost alike and each serving to support a finger finally each finger contains a succession of small bone called phalanx of which the thumb ha two and all the others three each i will add that two bone serve to attach the arm to the body one is the shoulderblade a broad triangular bone situated on the back behind the shoulder the other is the collar bone slender and curved situated in front and extending from the shoulder to the base of the neck those are the collarbone that you can feel with your hand at the right and left above the breast while thus enumerating the part of the arm uncle paul guided the hand of each listener and made it feel the several bone a they were named emile had some difficulty with the learned term humerus and cubitus which he now heard for the first time nevertheless by paying close attention he found that he could easily remember them when the boy had all learned the name and the position of each bone in the human arm their uncle continued now examine with me this picture of a bat skeleton the bone marked o is the shoulderblade a with u it form the back of the shoulder and it is triangular wide and flat then the part marked cl is the shoulder and the bone that go from there to the base of the neck is the collarbone queried emile precisely i see how the rest go louis hastened to interpose the bone marked h is the humerus and the elbow is at the angle made by this bone with the next my turn now put in jules the two bone running side by side from the elbow to the wrist are marked cu and r the first is the cubitus the other the radius consequently ca is the wrist but there i get lost the wrist i told you explained uncle paul is composed of several small bone that structure we find at ca the bat wrist but then the hand queried jules the palm of the hand and the five finger which it support are represented by the rib of the wing and by po which is the thumb this is the shortest of the five finger a with man it form no part of the framework of the wing but is free and is furnished with a hooked nail which the animal us to cling by and also in walking finally this thumb ha two phalanx a in the human thumb and at the base is a small bone which in man form a part of the palm of the hand so much for the thumb now let u look at those four long bone that start from the wrist ca and spread out through the greater part of the wing together with the similar but shorter bone of the thumb they represent the series of five bone composing the framework of the human palm next come the finger with their phalanx ph in short except for a few slight difference the bat wing reproduces piece by piece the structure of the human arm yes jules admitted it all there even to the small bone of the wrist and finger is it possible that a poor bat can pattern after u so closely the horrid creature copy our arm to make itself wing your pride need not suffer from this close resemblance which you will find in different degree in a multitude of other animal especially among the mammal our next of kin in bodily structure in the formation of his body man enjoys no monopoly the dog the cat the donkey the oxeach and all of themshare with u a common stock of organ modified in detail and suited to the kind of life of each specie we recognize in the bat wing the fundamental plan of our arm we see it also no le plainly in the fore leg of the cat the dog and many other animal and we can trace a rude resemblance to our hand even in the donkey homely hoof i tell you these thing my child not to lessen in your eye the undeniable superiority of man but to inspire in you a fellow feeling for animal that are formed like u suffer a we do and are far too often the victim of our stupid cruelty whoever needlessly cause an animal to suffer commits a barbarous act an inhuman act inasmuch a he inflicts torture on flesh like our own he brutally misuse a body having the same mechanism a our own and the same power of suffering a to our superiority it is established preëminently by an exceptional characteristic that place u above all comparison even with creature that in their physical structure most closely resemble u this characteristic is reason the torch that light u in our search for truth it is the human soul which alone know itself and enjoys the sublime privilege of knowing it divine author in bat four of the five bone similar to those of our palm are greatly elongated a are also the corresponding finger and they together constitute the four rib on which is stretched the membrane of the wing just a silk is stretched on the rib of an umbrella thus it is at the sacrifice of what might have been a hand that the wing is formed therefore the scientist call all mammal of like structure with the bat chiropters meaning handwinged creature from two greek word signifying hand and wing of the five finger one only the thumb is left free in the bat and it is very small it is furnished a i said before with a nail or claw the four others destitute of nail are lengthened to serve a support to the membrane of the wing this membrane is a fold of the skin which start from the shoulder stretch between the four long finger of the hand and then attache itself to the hind leg the toe of which are all furnished with hooked nail or claw and do not depart from the ordinary shape of such member by virtue of the free thumb already described the wing are able to serve a foot in walking when these member are folded close to the animal side the bat grip the ground by thrusting in first the right claw and then the left and push itself forward with it hind foot in laborious and awkward leap thus it get over the ground at what might be called a fast pace but is soon tired out with the exertion hence it doe not walk except when sure it will not be molested or when it is compelled to do so by it position on a level surface where it can not launch itself into the air then a soon a possible it gain an elevated point from which it fly off for in order to unfold the hampering membrane that serve a wing and to throw itself into the air the bat need considerable free space which it can not get except by hurling itself from a height consequently in the cave inhabited by bat they never fail to secure an unimpeded drop with the hooked talon of a hind foot they cling to the roof head downward that is the way they rest the way they sleep at the slightest alarm the claw let go the wing spread and the animal is off what a queer way to sleep emile exclaimed hanging from the roof by one foot head downward and do they stay that way long without getting tired if necessary a good half of the year when he went to bed that night emile thought again of the bat way of sleeping but he preferred his own the bat sens of smell and hearing bat are nocturnal uncle paul continued the next day that is they leave their lurkingplaces only at nightfall to hunt in the evening twilight a a rule animal addicted to nocturnal hunting have very large eye that take in a much light a possible and thus these animal can see with very little light nightbird such a owl of all kind will furnish u a remarkable example a little later by a singular exception however despite their nocturnal habit bat have very small eye how then are they able to direct themselves in their swift flight so abrupt in it change of direction how above all are they aware of the presence of their tiny gamemoths and gnat they are guided especially by their sens of smell and hearing which are extraordinarily acute what do you say to the bat ear in this picture what animal of it size can show anything like them how they flare like enormous hearingtrumpets to receive the slightest sound the bat that bear them ha the expressive name of longeared bat longeared bat repeated jules thats the kind of name i like it describes the animal and show what there is about it that is out of the ordinary such prodigious ear are certainly made to hear sound inaudible to u by reason of their excessive faintness they enable their possessor to hear at a distance the beating of a moth wing and the fluttering of a gnat dancing in the air other bat which have smaller ear have a a substitute a sense of smell unequaled for it acuteness the high state of perfection of this sense is the result of the abnormal development of the nose which cover a good part of the face and give the animal a very strange appearance for example here is the head of a bat called the horseshoe bat this broad distended formation of curious shape that occupies almost the whole space between the eye and the mouth is the nose it end above in a large triangular leaflike expanse laterally it spread out in folded laminæ all together taking the shape of a horseshoe whence the name of the creature what odor however faint could escape such a nose the dog so famous for it keenness of scent chase the hare without seeing it guided solely by the odor left behind by the animal heated in the chase but how much keener the scent of the horseshoe bat must be when it chase in the same manner a moth that leaf no odor for any nose but it pursuer i sometimes wonder whether such a nose so abnormally developed may not be able to detect certain quality that are and always will be unknown to u for want of the mean to perceive them the horseshoe bat grotesque nose make you laugh my little friend it make me think i think of the thousand secret that nature hide from our sens and that would be a easy for u to learn a they would be valuable if we possessed the scent of a poor bat perhaps who can tell the horseshoe bat foresees with it nose the coming storm several day in advance it may scent the future hurricane smell the rainclouds coming from the other end of the earth know by detecting their odor what wind are about to blow foretell in similar manner what the weather is going to be and guided by perception of which we can form no idea it may make it plan for hunting insect that are sometimes abundant and sometimes scarce according to the state of the atmosphere if the horseshoe bat nose can do all that said jules we must agree that it is a firstrate sort of nose i make no positive assertion his uncle rejoined i merely have my suspicion the only thing that seems to me beyond doubt is that such an organ a the bat nose serf it owner a a source of sensation unknown to man you say so many wonderful thing about it uncle emile interposed that i shall end by thinking the horseshoe bat nose much more curious than ugly there another thing too ive just noticed why doe the creature have such fat cheek see what a puffedup face it ha in the picture with the bat uncle paul explained the chase is a short one lasting only one or two hoursin fact the short interval between sunset and dark the remainder of the twentyfour hour is passed in rest in the quiet of some cavern or grotto doe the animal then have but one meal in all this time and what if there are evening when hunting is out of the question the sky being overcast the wind too strong or rain falling so that the insect keep under cover the bat would then be subjected to long fast if it were impossible for it to lay in supply beforehand but these supply must be collected hastily on the wing with no interruption to the hunt which last so short a time hence it is that pouch are indispensable deep pouch in which the hunter can put his game a fast a he catch it the cheek exactly fill this office they can be enlarged at the creature willdistended so a to form roomy pocket in which the insect killed with a snap of the teeth can be stowed away these reserve pocket are called cheekpouches gluttonous monkey have them that is where the sheape fond of sweet put the lump of sugar given her and let it slowly melt so a to prolong the enjoyment of it well when the bat is out hunting it first satisfies it hunger and thenespecially when it nose the famous nose that we have just been talking about predicts unfavorable weather for the following daysit redoubles it exertion and stows away moth after moth in the depth of it elastic pouch it return to it quarter with cheek all distended now without fear of famine it can remain idle for several day if necessary hanging motionless by a hind claw it feed on it store of provision nibbling one at a time a hunger prompt the insect softened to taste in the reservoir of it cheek but it is high time we finished with the bat their history would be too long if i were to tell you all about them i will only ask jules what he think now of the animal he at first called hideous frankly uncle answered the boy these creature interest me now more than they disgust me their singular wing formed at the cost of what might have been hand their prodigious nose and immense ear which make up for their poor eyesight their cheek swollen so a to make pouch for their supply of foodall these have interested me very much the cheekpouches said emile where the bat put it game to soak and the nose that scent the coming storm seemed to me the most curious thing about the animal and i said louis shall never forget how many enemy bat deliver u from now you understand uncle paul rejoined or at least i hope you are beginning to understand that bat being so useful to u in destroying a multitude of ravaging insect and noteworthy for their singular structure should not inspire u with an unjustifiable repugnance and still le with a stupid rage to exterminate them let u leave in peace these poor creature that so valiantly earn their living by protecting our crop do not let u harm them under the foolish pretext that they are ugly for their supposed ugliness is in reality an admirable adaptation of bodily structure to the creature mode of life the hedgehog in his walled garden uncle paul allowed a couple of hedgehog which he had brought from the neighboring hill to wander at large one evening the child noticed them poking about in a lettuce patch why asked emile ha uncle paul put those animal in the garden and told u to leave them alone if we happened to come across them no doubt to make war on harmful insect answered louis stop look there one of them is turning up the earth with it little black snout ssh let keep still and see what it after the child crouched down behind a row of pea so a not to be seen the hedgehog now scratching with it paw now rummaging with the tip of it snout which resembles that of a pig finally unearthed a big fat white larva which had probably been clinging to the root of a lettuce plant the child ran to look at the captured game the hedgehog thus taken by surprise hastened to roll itself up into a ball bristling with spine in the disinterred worm jules easily recognized a junebug larva one of that ravenous and destructive race that uncle paul had already told them about 1 in the evening when they were all gathered together the hedgehog naturally became the subject of conversation several year ago said uncle paul a i wa returning home one evening at a late hour i chanced upon two hedgehog coming out from a pile of stone i tied them up in my handkerchief so a to bring them home and let them loose in my garden ever since then they have never failed to render me certain service that you can appreciate by examining the jaw in this picture pointed teeth like those jules remarked were never made for browsing grass the hedgehog must feed on prey it teeth are just right for crunching junebug worm such a i saw dug up in the garden this morning notice how sharp the point of the teeth are resumed his uncle both in the upper and in the lower jaw those two row of teeth fit into each other when the animal bite and they plunge like so many fine dagger into the captured victim flesh with this complicated dental mechanism evidently the hedgehog can not triturate tough food it must have a kind of diet that is soft juicy capable of being reduced to marmalade by a brief chewing the animal is therefore preëminently a flesheater several other specie particularly the mole and the shrewmouse of these region have like the hedgehog teeth tapering to conical point and interplaying in the two jaw their food too is about the same a the hedgehog all threehedgehog mole and shrewmouselive on small gameinsects larvæ slug caterpillar worm they belong to the group of mammal known to naturalist a the order of insectivorous animal or in other word the order of insecteaters on and under the ground they carry on the same kind of hunt that bat do in the air in their way of living bat too are insectivorous but their peculiar bodily structure cause them to be placed apart in the order of chiropters thus the mammal furnish u two order of helper the chiropters which hunt on the wing and the insecteatersthe insectivorous animal properly so calledwhich hunt on and under the ground to the latter belong the hedgehog the mole and the shrewmouse the hedgehog the largest of the three requires the largest and most plentiful prey tiny vermin are disdained but a junebug larva or a good fat molecricket is an excellent find when they are not buried too deep he dig with his paw and snout to unearth them you have today seen my hedgehog at work in the lettuce bed all night they go prowling about the garden sniffing and rummaging in every nook and corner and crunching no small number of my foe without doing me much harm in them i have two vigilant watchman who make their round every night for the greater security of my growing vegetable however despite the interest i take in them i must to be candid acknowledge their fault the hedgehog natural food consists unquestionably of insect but when a good opportunity present itself the greedy creature is easily tempted by larger and more highly flavored prey in it wild state the hedgehog doe not hesitate to suck the blood of young rabbit caught in their hole during the mother absence the egg of quail and partridge too it esteem a a most delicious feast but it supreme delight is to wring the neck of a brood of little chicken one night last year i heard a great commotion in the henhouse the rooster were raising cry of alarm the hen were cackling in desperate fright i ran out to see what the trouble wa one of my hedgehog had crept in under the door and i found the rogue regaling himself on some little chicken almost under their mother wing she being powerless to help them in the dark with one kick i sent the assassin rolling outside and the next day thorough repair were taken in hand the hole on a level with the floor were closed up and since then i have had no further trouble from my insecthunters with proper precaution against their thirst for blood i have two larvadevourers of great value for my garden but wont they do damage of another kind asked louis i have heard that hedgehog climb tree and shake off the ripe fruit and then roll on it so a to spit it with their spine after which they carry it off to their hole and eat it at their ease pay no attention to any such story my boy it is utterly impossible for a hedgehog to climb a tree clumsy and stubby a it is with leg so short and claw useless for climbing how could it manage an athletic feat that call for agility hooked claw and supple limb no my friend the hedgehog doe not climb tree neither doe it carry off fruit transfixed with it spine the only vestige of truth in that old wife tale is that hedgehog do not live exclusively on prey if they find fruit that they like on the ground a very ripe pear or a juicy peach for example they munch it with a great contentment a they would a beetle or a junebug it is also said louis added that if kept in a house the hedgehog will drive away rat ah that i am quite willing to believe by day the animal crouch in a corner and sleep but at night it is on the move always hunting for slug fat beetle and other insect consequently it may well be that it noisy hunt for prey a it go poking it pointed snout into every hole and cranny frightens the rat and mouse and drive them away especially a the nocturnal prowler exhales a disagreeable odor calculated to betray it presence having neither the cat light paw nor that animal great patience in lying in wait for game the hedgehog doe not indulge in hunting rat but if by good luck one fall into it clutch it is accepted with delight for the hedgehog great feast is blood freshly killed flesh when i wish to give my two hedgehog a special treat i throw them a bleeding beef liver or a chicken entrails anything of that sort is eagerly devoured taste so undisguisedly carnivorous tell you what must happen to a mouse caught by one of these animal i attribute to them the disappearance of some nest of rat that used to trouble me to satisfy it devouring hunger the hedgehog appears to attack all sort of prey alike even planting it teeth in a viper without any thought of the reptile venom and in still other respect the animal enjoys a remarkable immunity you have seen the spanish fly that magnificent strongsmelling insect that life on ashtrees and is distinguished by sheath wing of a superb golden green yes i remember it said jules it is used for raising blister after being dried and ground to powder that is correct if then this powder eats into the skin so readily what effect ought it to have on the delicate lining of the stomach if introduced into that organ what animal could swallow it without suffering torture and speedy death well by an exception that i can not undertake to explain the hedgehog can feed on this horrible poison without the slightest apparent injury a celebrated russian naturalist pallas ha seen it make a meal on spanish fly with no ill result for a repast of that sort a stomach peculiarly constructed is certainly necessary once upon a time there wa a king very well known in history named mithridates being aware that he wa surrounded by enemy capable of poisoning him some day in order to obviate the danger he gradually accustomed himself to the most noxious drug by increasing the dose little by little he finally rendered himself immune against poison the hedgehog is the mithridates of the animal kingdom but how far it surpasses the suspicious king without practice it dare swallow the poison of the spanish fly and the viper deadly venom i like to believe that the hedgehog ha not received these exceptional gift only to leave them unused it must delight to frequent the haunt of the viper in it nocturnal round in the underbrush it must occasionally come upon the reptile in it retreat and crush it head with those pointed teeth that are so well adapted to such work what service may it not render in locality infested with this dangerous breed and yet man rage at the hedgehog curse it most heartily and treat it a an unclean beast of no use but to arouse the fury of dog which can not attack it because of it spine he subject it to the torture of an icecold bath to make it unroll itself and if the animal refuse to do so he prod it with a pointed stick goad it disembowels it we will never meddle with hedgehog uncle paul jules assured him we are too much afraid of snake to drive away this valiant defender what are the hedgehog spine asked emile hair nothing else but very coarse and stiff and pointed like needle together with other hair fine soft and silky they cover all the upper part of the body the under part ha only a coat of soft hair otherwise the animal would wound itself in rolling up into a ball when the hedgehog scent dangerand it is a very wary beastit duck it head under it stomach draw in it paw and roll itself into a ball presenting everywhere an armor of spine to the enemy the fox ha long been famous for it many rus the hedgehog ha only one but it is always effective who would dare grapple with the creature when it ha assumed it attitude of defense the dog refuse after a few luckless essay that make it mouth bleed it decline to go further and content itself with barking sheltered under the safe cover of it spine the hedgehog turn a deaf ear to these futile threat and remains quiet but if the dog urged on by it master return to the charge the hedgehog ha recourse to a last expedient of war which rarely fails of effect it discharge it strongly offensive urine which flow from the inside of the ball and wet the outside repelled by the unbearable odor of the illsmelling beast and pricked on the nose by it spine even the most eager dog now abandon the attack the enemy gone the hedgehog slowly unrolls itself and trot off to some safe retreat hibernation our bat continued uncle paul live exclusively on insect and these constitute the hedgehog chief food but it also hunt larger game or even eats fruit in winter there are no longer any plump insect to be had most of them having died after laying their egg and the few surviving one having taken refuge from the cold in hidingplaces where they would be very hard to find the larvæ too the hope of future generation are lying torpid far out of sight under the ground in the trunk of old tree snugly hidden away the white worm ha bored several foot into the ground to escape the frost there are no more junebugs for the longeared owl no more nightflying moth and no more beetle for the hedgehog what then is to become of these insecteaters they will die of hunger answered jules they would indeed all die were it not for the providential arrangement i am now going to try to make you understand you know the proverb he who sleep dinesa very true proverb in it simple statement of an undeniable fact well the hedgehog the bat and other animal put the principle into practice with a wisdom quite equal to that of man not being able to dine for want of insect they go to sleep and so deep and heavy is their sleep that to designate it we use a special word lethargy another proverb say a you make your bed so must you lie our dumb animal never lacking in wisdom in ordering their own affair take good care not to forget this proverb but to adopt wise precaution before abandoning themselves to their long winter sleep the hedgehog chooses for itself a secure retreat amid the great root of some old tree stump toward the end of the autumn it carry grass and dry leaf to deposit there and arranges them in a hollow ball in the middle of which it roll itself up and go to sleep bat assemble in great number in the warm depth of some cavern where nothing can disturb their slumber head down and body packed close together they hug the wall covering them with a sort of velvet tapestry or clinging to one another they hang in bunch from the roof now the winter may do it worst and the wind may rage the hedgehog in it warm blanket of leaf and the bat in their sheltered cave sleep a deep sleep until summer return and with it insect food animation life but dont they eat anything all winter long asked emile incredulously nothing whatever his uncle assured him then bat and hedgehog must have a secret for my part i eat more in the winter than at any other time and no amount of sleep would satisfy my hunger yes the bat and the hedgehog have a secret in this matter i am going to tell you this secret but it is a little hard to understand i warn you there is one need before which hunger and thirst are silent however great they may be a need that is never satisfied and is always making itself felt whether we wake or sleep by night by day every hour every minute it is the need of air air is so essential to the maintenance of life that it ha not been left to u to regulate it use a we do in regard to food and drink and this is so in order that we may not be exposed to the fatal consequence that would follow the slightest forgetfulness therefore it is with little or no consciousness on our part and independently of our will that air gain entrance into our body to do it marvelous work there on air more than on anything else do we live our daily bread coming only second in the order of importance our need of food is felt at only tolerably long interval our need of air is felt unceasingly always imperious always inexorable let any one try for a moment to prevent it admission into the body by closing the entrance passage the mouth and the nostril almost immediately he is suffocated and feel that he would surely die if this state were prolonged a little and what is true of man is true of all form of animal life air is necessary to them all from the smallest to the greatest what i am going to tell you now will explain this absolute necessity for air for the maintenance of life man and also every animal of a superior organizationa classification that includes mammal and birdshave a temperature of their own a degree of bodily heat peculiar to them a heat resulting from no external condition but from the function of life alone whether under a burning sun or in the freezing cold of winter whether subjected to the torrid heat of the equator or to the glacial climate of the pole man body ha a temperature of thirtyeight degree centigrade and can not be lowered without danger of death the natural heat of bird attains fortytwo degree in all season and in all climate how is it that this heat is always the same and whence can it come unless from some sort of combustion there is in fact going on within u a perpetual combustion respiration furnishing the necessary air and food supplying the fuel to live is to consume oneself in the strictest sense of the word to breathe is to burn in a figurative sense man ha long used the expression the torch of life but this figurative term prof to be the exact utterance of the truth air consumes the torch it consumes the animal no le it make the torch give out heat and light and it produce in the animal heat and motion without air the torch go out without air the animal dy from this point of view the animal may be compared to a highly perfected machine put in motion by heat it feed and breathes to produce heat and motion it receives it fuel in the form of food and burn it in the inmost recess of it body with the help of the air introduced by breathing that explains why the need of food is greater in winter than in summer the body cooling off more rapidly by contact with the outside cold air and consequently an increased consumption of fuel being required to maintain the normal temperature a low temperature creates a desire for food a high temperature lessens the demand to the hungry siberian hearty food is necessary they ask for bacon and other fat with brandy to drink but for the people of sahara a few date suffice with a pinch of flour kneaded in the palm of the hand with a little water everything that lessens the loss of heat lessens also the need of food sleep rest warm clothing all serve to some extent a substitute for food and so there is much truth in the saying that he who sleep dines that may be jules assented but i dont see how hedgehog and bat can do without food for four or five month at a time no matter how soundly i might sleep i couldnt go without eating so long a that wait until i finish and for the present remember this in every animal life depends on an actual and neverceasing combustion air a necessary to this combustion a to the burning of wood or coal in our stove and fireplace is taken into the body by breathing that is what make breathing so urgent so incessant a to the fuel burned that is furnished by the substance of the animal itself by the blood made from digested food not a finger is lifted by u not a muscle moved that doe not use up just so much of the fuel furnished by the blood which itself is made by the food we eat walking running working excitement all form of exercise or emotionthese literally burn up our blood just a a locomotive burn it coal in dragging behind it the immense weight of a train that is why activity hard work increase our need for food while rest idleness lessens it i will now put to you a question let u suppose that there are on the hearth some burning brand but that they are few and small and you wish to keep the fire a long a possible would you let these firebrand burn freely would you take the bellow and blow air on them to increase the blaze no replied jules that would be just the way to burn up the brand in no time they must be covered with ash if the air come to them very slowly and only a little at a time they will burn gradually and the next morning we shall find the coal still alive that is well said my boy to keep up a fire for a long time with a given amount of fuel the draft must be reduced the access of air must be largely cut off but not intercepted altogether because then the fire would be completely extinguished therefore the live coal are buried under ash and if the fire is in a stove the door of the ashpit is nearly closed with plenty of air combustion is active but of short duration with only a little air it is feeble but last a long time a the maintenance of life is the result of a real combustion any animal obliged to endure a long fast or in other word to dispense with the regular renewal of the fuel needed in that combustion must take into it body a little air a possible it must reduce the draft of it furnace this draft is respiration breathing and so in order to go without food for month at a time and to make the small amount of fuel held in reserve in the vein last a long a possible the animal ha but one course to follow it must breathe a little a it can without depriving itself entirely of air for that would mean the total extinction of the vital spark just a the complete cutting off of air from a lighted lamp mean the speedy extinction of it flame there you have the hedgehog and the bat secret for enduring their long fast through the winter season first of all every precaution is taken to avoid all loss all unnecessary expenditure of heat and to economize a much a possible the reserve of fuel in their poor little vein the hedgehog wrap itself up warm in a thick blanket of leaf in the heart of a stoneheap or in some hollow tree trunk while the bat collect in compact group in the warm shelter of a deep cave but that is not enough they must keep quite still a every movement us up a certain amount of heat this requirement is scrupulously observed their immobility is such that you would say they were dead and yet all this is still insufficient respiration must be reduced to a minimum in fact their breathing is so weak that the closest scrutiny can hardly detect that they breathe at all this faint remnant of life is not to be compared you can well see to the blazing torch or the brightly burning fire both of which enjoying free combustion send out wave of heat and light it is rather the feeble glimmer of a night lamp husbanding it last drop of oil it is the coal that glow faintly under the ash so profound is the torpor so nearly complete the inanition that were it not followed by an awakening this state would hardly differ in any respect from death the name hibernation is given to this temporary suspension of vitality or rather this slowing up of life to which certain animal are subject during the winter in the number of hibernating animal or animal that indulge in this long winter sleep are to be included besides the hedgehog and the bat the marmot the dormouse the lizard serpent of various kind frog and other reptile do you need to be told that in order to assume and maintain this torpid condition in which for whole month food is unnecessary a special organization is required not every creature can hold it breath at will and thus escape the necessity of eating the dog and the cat might sleep ever so deeply yet a their breathing would go on almost a actively a in their waking hour hunger would arouse them before long just a it would me said emile no animal that have an assured supply of food for the winter hibernate but those that would otherwise perish with hunger in cold weather are saved from destruction by the providential torpor that overtakes them at the approach of the winter season their food supply being cut off they go to sleep the marmot is wrapped in slumber while the turf on the high mountain is covered with snow the dormouse when there is no longer any fruit frog toad snake lizard bat and hedgehog a soon a there cease to be any more insect to feed upon the mole uncle paul had just trapped a mole that for some day had been uprooting young vegetable and unearthing newly planted seed in a corner of the garden he called the childrens attention to the animal black coat softer than the finest velvet showed them it snout and made them note it peculiar fitness for digging pointed to it fore paw shaped like wide shovel for moving the earth with astonishing rapidity and remarked on it eye so small a to be wellnigh useless and it jaw armed with savagelooking teeth it is a great pity said he that we are prejudiced against the mole on account of it habit of mining for there is not in all the world a more pitiless destroyer of vermin i had always heard louis remarked and had believed until now that mole lived on a vegetable diet chiefly of root and that they tunneled under the ground to get them to forewarn you of the error so widely current on the subject of the diet of certain animal i described to you in some detail the formation of teeth which always indicate the kind of food eaten i showed you that one ha only to examine an animal teeth in order to determine whether it is carnivorous or herbivorous remember the adage that summed up our talk on the subject show me it teeth and i will tell you what the animal eats the mole is a good illustration it ha fortyfour sharply pointed teeth not including the incisor do they look like millstone for the leisurely grinding of grain and root or sharp tool for making mincemeat of torn flesh they are certainly the teeth of an animal that life on prey louis admitted the hedgehog and the bat havent sharper one to make you sure of this fact uncle paul went on i will tell you about some experiment made on the diet of mole we owe them to a learned french naturalist flourens if after you are grown up you ever have a chance to read his remarkable work you will find them very interesting and valuable flourens put two live mole into a cask and believing them to be herbivorous gave them for food a supply of root carrot and turnip a you see the illustrious naturalist shared the accepted opinion the false notion just repeated by louis but flourens wa soon undeceived the next morning the vegetable were found untouched while one of the mole had been devoured by it companion and there wa nothing left of it but the skin turned inside out one of the mole had eaten the other cried emile oh what a fierce creature it had feasted on it own kind a thing that hardly any other animal doe in devouring it comrade it had in the course of the night eaten it own weight of food and yet the next morning it seemed restless and very hungry flourens threw it a live sparrow whose wing he had just clipped the mole smelt it walked around it received a few hard peck from it beak then pouncing on the bird tore it stomach open and enlarged the opening with it claw so a to plunge it head into the midst of the entrails with it pointed snout the horrible creature bored into them with frantic delight in le than no time it had devoured half the content of the skin which with it feather wa left whole flourens then lowered into the cask a glass full of water and saw the mole stand up against the glass cling to the edge with it fore claw and drink eagerly when it had had enough the animal returned to the sparrow ate a little more of it and finally completely full lay down to sleep in a corner the glass and the remains of the bird were then taken out of the cask hardly six hour later the mole hungry again began to smell around the bottom of the cask in search of something to eat a second sparrow wa thrown to it the mole immediately tore open the stomach to get at it entrails when it had eaten most of the bird and taken another big drink of water it appeared satisfied and remained quiet this wa it last meal for the day just think boy what a quantity of reeking flesh it took to satisfy one mole hunger in the night it companion in captivity and the next day two sparrow the weight of the food eaten in twentyfour hour wa nearly twice that of the eater wa the animal satisfied for long by no mean the next morning the mole wa wandering restlessly about in the bottom of it cask apparently wild with hunger food quick quick or it will die of starvation the remains of the sparrow left over from the evening before with a frog which it promptly disemboweled quieted it for a while finally a toad wa thrown to it a soon a the mole approached to rip it up the toad inflated it body hoping perhaps to frighten the enemy with it repulsive appearance at any rate it succeeded after sniffing at it the mole turned away in disgust ah you dont want the toad you greedy creature then you shall have turnip cabbage and carrot plenty of these were given it but fie on root rather perish than eat turnip the next morning the mole wa found to have starved to death amid the vegetable it had scorned to touch them with so much a a tooth had this animal an exceptional appetite a taste for unusual thing that it should have preferred to die of hunger rather than touch vegetable food not at all it merely followed the preference of all it kind many other experiment have been performed both by flourens and by other observer all the mole they have tried to feed with vegetable substanceswith bread lettuce cabbage root herbage of any descriptionhave starved to death without touching their provision on the other hand those that were fed with raw flesh worm larvæ and insect of various kind remained alive another very simple way to determine positively the kind of food eaten by this animal is to examine the content of it stomach a it life in the freedom of it customary haunt everything eaten by it must find it way to the stomach let u catch a mole cut it open and investigate the stomach is found to contain sometimes red piece of common earthworm or it may be a pap of beetle recognizable from the scaly remains that have not been digested or still again and rather oftener we find a marmalade of larvæ especially the larvæ of junebugsundigested bit of mandible and the hard shell of the skull in short one is likely to come upon a mixed hash of all the small creature inhabiting the soil such a woodlouse milliped cutworm moth in the chrysalis state caterpillar and subterranean nymph but no matter how carefully we search we can not find a bit of vegetable matter all possible observation point to the same conclusion despite what is believed by so many it is certain that the mole diet is confined to animal substance and could it i ask you be otherwise would the stomach content belie the savage set of teeth you have just seen in the picture do not it teeth show that it is a flesheater yes the mole eats flesh and nothing else everything prof this besides remember it big appetite if one may call appetite the raging demand of a stomach that in twelve hour requires a quantity of food equal to the weight of the animal the mole existence is a gluttonous frenzy this frenzy seizes the creature three or four time a day and it dy of starvation if it ha to go without food for more than a few hour to satisfy it appetite when it food melt away and disappears almost a soon a swallowed what can the mole count on live sparrow which it devoured with such zest in the experiment of flourens are evidently not for a hunter that burrow underground at most some stray frog found in the field may fall into it clutch what then is left for it to count on the larvæ buried underground and especially those of the junebug tender and fat a bacon that is very little i admit for such hunger but the number to be had will make up for the smallness of the prey what a slaughter of white worm must take place when the soil abounds in this small game scarcely is one meal finished when another begin and each time no doubt other small insect are eaten by the dozen to free a field of these destroyer of our crop there is no helper equal to the mole a valued destroyer of verminthat is what we defend when we take the mole part and give to it even if somewhat reluctantly the honorable title of helper that title in truth it only partly deserves to catch the cricket the larvæ the white worm and the insect of all kind that it feed on the mole is obliged to disturb the root amid which it prey is to be found many that interfere with it in it work are cut plant have their root laid bare and are even uprooted altogether and finally the earth dug up by this untiring miner is piled on the surface in little mound or molehill with such upturning of the soil a field of vegetable may be speedily ruined and a crop of grain badly damaged one night is enough for a mole to undermine a large tract for the famished creature is singularly quick in boring the soil where it hope to find something to eat it is well equipped for making it underground gallery which often are hundred of meter long the body is stubby and almost cylindrical from one end to the other so a to slip with the least resistance through the narrow passage bored by the animal the fur is short thick and carefully curried so that it shall not catch the dust and may be kept perfectly clean even in the most dusty soil the tail is very short and the external ear are wanting although the hearing is remarkably acute ear like those of animal that live in the open would be in the way underground in the mole they are made very tiny for the animal greater convenience no luxurious outfit doe it ask for but only what is strictly necessary for it work of mining eye wide open so that the dirt could get into them would be a perpetual torment to the creature and besides what use could it make of them in the total darkness of it abode the mole is not exactly blind a is generally believed it ha two eye but these are very small and set so deep in the surrounding fur that they can be of little use it is guided by the sense of smell in which it rival the pig and like the pig it ha a snout of the right shape for digging up a toothsome morsel with it snout the pig find and root out the savory titbit buried in the ground the mole in like manner discovers and dig up the plump white worm to reach it amid a network of root and under a considerable thickness of soil the animal ha it fore paw which spread out like large strong hand with exceptionally tough nail these handsstout shovel which if need be can open a passage through tufa a soft sort of rockare the mole principal tool a the animal advance digging with it snout and clearing away with it hand the earth is thrown to the rear by it hind foot which are much weaker than the hand but strong enough for the far lighter task if the mole proposes to return by the same road the track must be kept clear accordingly the earth dug up is thrown outside to form molehill at interval for the present these detail will suffice now let u take up the muchdiscussed question of the mole usefulness should we considering the undoubted service it render u let it live in our field or ought we rather on account of it destructive digging to look upon it a an enemy and wage war on it most people seem to feel we should make war on itwar to the death some person make it a practice to destroy every mole they find and there is small pity bestowed upon the little creature unearthed by the spade but i should like to remind the mole pitiless enemy that insect do far worse damage and that for ridding a field of insect nothing is equal to this bloodthirsty hunter notwithstanding all opinion to the contrary i believe that mole in moderate number are needed in a field that it is unwise to destroy them all indeed experience ha proved this i know of region where the mole have been hunted down and destroyed until not one wa left now do you know what wa the result the white worm multiplied so that they ate up everything in the field to get rid of the worm it wa necessary to let the mole come back and to let them stay so long a they did not become too numerous and there is something else to be said for the mole molehill are formed of wellworked earth which when spread about with the rake is very good for young grass further the creature subterranean gallery serve a drain for keeping the soil in a sanitary condition letting off the extra water just a regular drain would do on the whole then after weighing the argument on both side i am of the opinion that the mole ought not to be banished from our field unless it multiplies to excess and how about garden queried louis that is another question in a few hour a mole can almost ruin a garden who would want such a digger among his growing vegetable you carefully sow your seed set out your young plant even off the ground and make waterchannels the very next morningplague take the creature it ha turned everything topsyturvy quick a spade a trap and let u get rid of the pest a soon a possible suppose however that cutworm and other destructive vermin abound shall we gain anything by killing the mole certainly not the insect will speedily do more harm than the mole ha just wrought greater mischief is in store and that is all there is about it if i had a garden infested with destructive insect here is what i should do in the spring i should let loose in my garden half a dozen mole taken alive in the field and i should then leave them to pursue their hunting in peace their work done the ground cleaned i should take the mole away you can catch them whenever you want to asked louis nothing easier you shall see for yourself the mole nestthe shrewmouse all that you know of the mole labor is confined to the little mound of earth the molehill that it throw up and the tunnel of greater or le extent that it bore just beneath the surface of the soil these tunnel are huntingtrails made by the animal in order to search amid the root for the larvæ it life on if the ground is full of game the mole halt there probing to right and left wherever it smell a grub if the spot is a poor one it prolongs the tunnel or bore fresh one hither and thither in every direction until it find a place to suit it but however abundant the larvæ may be one vein is soon exhausted whereupon the old digging are abandoned and fresh one undertaken from day to day near it huntingground thus honeycombed with a succession of tunnel a called for the mole ha a burrow a fixed abode to which it retires to rest sleep and rear it young this burrow is a work of art a strong castle in the making of which the cautious animal us great skill with a view to the utmost possible security you must not think i am talking about the molehill which are merely the dirt thrown out in the digging the mole is never to be found lurking beneath these crumbling hillock it dwelling is something quite different it is underground at a depth of nearly a meter usually beneath a hedge or at the foot of a wall or amid the big root of some great tree this natural shelter make it strong so that it will not cave in it main part is a chamber c shaped somewhat like an inverted bottle carefully roughcoated with loam and made smooth on the inside it is furnished with a warm bed of moss and dry grass that is the mole restingplace it bedroom the family nest two circular tunnel run around it at a distance the lower one a larger the upper one b of lesser diameter they serve a sentryposts for the safeguarding of the main chamber stationed in the upper tunnel which is reached by three passage leading from the large chamber the mole listens to what is going on outside if some danger threatens half a dozen exit are provided for speedy descent to the lower tunnel whence there are numerous outlet for instant flight these lead in all direction but soon bend back and into the main passage p if danger overtakes the mole in it inmost retreat c it escape by the tunnel h which lead out from below wind around and rejoins the main passage p i get lost in all those tunnel and passage said emile the mole house is very complicated for u perhaps but not for the mole it know every twist and turn of these winding tunnel and can get away at very short notice you think you can catch it in it home but in a twinkling it is gone and you dont know in what direction the passage for flight both those that go in all direction from the lower circular tunnel and those that run straight from the chamber all lead finally into the passage marked p the entranceway to the mole abode and this passage is the main one between the large chamber and the huntingground the permanent highway over which the mole pass to and fro three or four time a dayin fact every time it go on an expedition or return home this passage meant to last a long a the dwelling remains in use is much more carefully made than the simple burrow bored from day to day a the mole seek it food it is deeper down wider smooth and well beaten no molehill is over it it covering of earth is solid yet something betrays it to the searcher eye on account of the mole incessant coming and going the root of any plant growing there are more injured than are those over the ordinary tunnel made by the animal consequently the grass ha an unhealthy yellowish look once this passage is knownand the strip of yellow grass point it outthe mole can be caught at any time a trap is set inside the tunnel obliged to pas through either to get out or to come in the mole can not fail to be taken sooner or later that is plain enough said louis i see now how easy it would be to catch mole again whenever you want to after they have been let loose in a garden to rid it of insect to conclude my account of insectivorous animal uncle paul went on i will now tell you about the very smallest of mammal a tiny creature not more than two inch long this cunning little animal look somewhat like a mouse but is much smaller the tail is shorter the head more tapering and the nose end in a sharper point the ear are short and rounded but the coat is almost the same a that of the mouse the shrewmouse ha the same taste a the mole it is an ardent hunter of small game a devourer of larvæ and insect a you can see by it finely serrate teeth it slender body made for squeezing into the smallest hole and it long snout shaped for prying into the narrowest cranny and crevice enable it to go wherever vermin may be lurking woe to the woodlouse rolled up like a tiny pellet in some crack in the wall and to the slug hiding under a stone the shrewmouse will have no difficulty in catching them being so small that it could make it home in a nutshell it will not help them to hide for the shrewmouse doe not need to see them in order to find them it detects them by it subtle sense of smell and hears them if they make the slightest movement the burrow of the beetle the warren of the larvæ the lurkingplaces of the tiniest worm hold no secret from the shrewmouse it might be appropriately called the insect ferret these little creature are to be found in field and meadow and garden and in winter they come near our house and make their nest under strawstacks and dungheaps in very cold weather they even find their way into stable where they live on cockroach and woodlouse but at the approach of summer they are off again to the open field where they complete the mole work of extermination or they may seek some garden where they protect the wallfruit and the vegetable patch from the devouring insect horde without ever touching any of the growing crop themselves the teeth of the shrewmouse are not made for the chewing of vegetable food like the mole this tiny creature is carnivorous moreover in their huntingraids which are so greatly to our advantage shrewmouse never do u the slightest injury of any sort a they never bore tunnel but merely use the natural crack in the soil they can not be reproached with severing root or throwing up mound of earth a mole do and yet they are perhaps more an object of general execration than the latter it is considered a praiseworthy act to crush them every time one get a chance how ha so tiny pleasing and useful a creature managed thus to incur the hatred of man we have here my child another instance of the foolish way we accept the first notion that enters our head without trying to test it by observation and reason it is said that the shrewmouse bite horse foot and leaf incurable wound but how can a shrewmouse whose head is at most no larger than a pea bite a horse and pierce it hide which is the thickness of a finger or more again they say the shrewmouse is venomous even for man some time ago child i told you about the viper 2 you know what it weapon aretwo long sharp teeth or fang having little channel through which it introduces a drop of venom into the wound it inflicts well i assure you the shrewmouse ha no weapon like the viper it ha neither fang nor a poisonsac but is wholly harmless to man and horse insect alone need fear it fine teethnot that they are poisoned in any way but because they crunch their little victim very neatly i think i see why the shrewmouse ha incurred the charge of being venomous the pretty little creature exhales an odor it smell rather strongly of musk the cat taking it for a mouse sometimes chase it but repelled by it odor never eats it the first to observe this fact said to himself a the cat doe not dare eat it the shrewmouse must be venomous ever since then this false belief ha passed for truth in the country and no one ha taken the trouble to look into the matter more closely so that the poor little shrewmouse one of our most useful and harmless helper fall a victim to the stupidity of man whose garden it protects the exploit of oneeyed john it happened one day that oneeyed john caught an owl in his corncrib and he had just nailed the live bird to his house door a a bandit of the worst kind worthy to be exposed to the jeer of all who passed and to dry up on the spot so a to serve a a scarecrow john wa very proud of his deed he laughed at the clickclacking of the bird beak at the desperate rolling of the eye a the owl hung there crucified it grimace and contortion the convulsive effort of the wing to free themselves from the big nail that pierced them and the fit of impotent rage expressed by the spasmodic working of the talon put him in the best of humor the child of the neighborhood cruel and heartless a is usual at their age and still more cruel when grown person set the sad example had gathered before the door and were joining in the laugh at the owl suffering john told them that his neighbor old annette had died two week before because the owl came three time in quick succession and hooted on the roof of the house those creature said he are badluck bird at night they fly into church and drink the oil out of the lamp they perch on the roof of sick people house and foretell their death and they snuggle into a hole in the belfry and laugh when the bell toll for a funeral all this of course frightened the child see said the youngest pressing close to his brother how the owl threatens u with it big red eye it must be awfully wicked it so ugly said another let hurt it that will teach it to laugh when people die and to drink oil out of the holy lamp john put it eye out with this pointed stick it look at u so wickedly and put this piece of glass in it claw so that it will cut it finger and thus each one did what he could to harm the helpless creature each tried to invent some new torture for it just then louis happened to come along and the child called to him to join them in tormenting the owl more merciful than his comrade especially since he had fallen into the way of visiting uncle paul house louis turned his eye away from this frightful spectacle and begged john to end the bird agony instead of making it suffer still further torture but the boy entreaty were all in vain and he went away much distressed a he wa going home he recalled something uncle paul had said in one of his talk he had told the boy that when the ignorant crowd agrees to call a thing black it is always well to see whether after all the thing may not be white here is oneeyed john said louis to himself oneeyed john known all about here for his ignorance he ha never in his life opened a book and he glory in the fact he cant sign his name and he reject with mulish obstinacy every wise suggestion at this very moment he is urging on the child against that poor owl he ha just nailed to his door and to make them think there is some reason why he should be so cruel he tell them it is a graveyard bird a badluck bird that brings misfortune to people according to his account the owl is an evil creature full of malice and deserves no pity we must punish it for it wickedness make it suffer torment a an example to others of it kind and put it to death without mercy but what if just the opposite of all this should be true what if the owl were really a harmless creature or even a very useful one and worthy of our protection i must find out accordingly that evening at uncle paul this wa the first thing he asked about at louis description of the tortured owl uncle paul at once recognized it specie the bird that john thought he must nail alive to his door said he is the belfryowl also called the barnowl the unfortunate creature in no way deserved the frightful treatment it received i pity it for having fallen into hand made cruel by ignorance stupidity and malice go together they say and it is very true he who is ignorant is deliberately cruel wild and foolish thing are said against the barnowl and john repeated them having heard them from some one else he now in his turn pass them on to the street urchin who were so eager to put out the bird eye it is not true that the barnowl fly into church and drink the oil from the lamp that is kept lighted night and day in the sanctuary it is not true that it laugh when it hears the passingbell it is not true that it hooting on the roof of a house mean that some one in the house will soon die false are all the saying about it evil influence and it prediction of misfortune and any one who belief these absurd story simply show that he ha no common sense we are in god hand my child and god alone know when our last hour is to come let u pity those feebleminded person who believe the owl know this tremendous secret let u pity them but never let u abuse our reasoning power by believing that an owl in expressing after it own fashion on some houseroof it satisfaction at having caught a mouse is solemnly foretelling what is going to happen uncle paul nephew must henceforth pay not the slightest attention to any such superstitious notion let u go on what would you say of john if he had taken it into his head to kill his cat by nailing the animal to the door by it fore paw i should say answered louis that if rat ever ate him up it would serve him right what you saw him doing amount to about the same thing he wa torturing one of the very best destroyer of mouse a bird in form a cat in habit the barnowl went into the corncrib to guard the poor man wheat from rat and john a prey to superstitious hatred and never thinking of the service the owl wa doing him made haste to nail the useful bird to his door what strange wrongheadedness is it that make u all a a rule destroy the animal that help u most almost all our helper are persecuted their good will must be very strong else our ill treatment would long ago have driven them forever from our dwelling and field bat rid u of a host of enemy but none the le we look upon them with dislike the mole and the shrewmouse purge the soil of vermin and we dislike them too the hedgehog make war on viper and white worm and we make war on him the owl and various other nightbird are fine rathunters but that doe not save them from mistreatment still other animal that i will tell you about later do the most useful work for u and we persecute them all they are ugly people say and for no other reason they are killed but blind slayer shall you not at last have your eye opened to the fact that because of an unreasonable dislike you have sacrificed your own defender you complain of ratsand you nail the owl to your door where you let it carcass dry up a hideous trophy you complain of the white wormsand you crush the mole every time the spade brings one to light you rip up the hedgehog and set your dog on him just for fun you complain of the ravage of moth in your granary and if a bat fall into your hand you seldom spare it you complain and yet you mistreat all the animal that offer to help you blind you are and sadly misguided in your wanton cruelty regarded merely a it affect his own interest it is a pitiful piece of work that john ha done but it is far more pitiful in respect to the torture he ha inflicted on the bird it is not the mark of a man but of a brute to take pleasure in torturing an animal it is a wicked act and one that good men despise ignorance is the cause of the act but ignorance is not an excuse if an animal is harmful to u let u get rid of it by killing it but let u never think of inflicting needle pain of causing suffering simply for suffering sake that would be to smother in ourselves one of the noblest of sentiment compassion it would mean the arousing of savage instinct which too often lead to crime he who find his pleasure in torturing dumb animal can not take pity on the suffering of his own kind his heart is hardened and prone to evil how i pity those poor child who stood by and laughed at the barnowls horrible suffering and who led on by the man example helped to put out the wretched bird eye how i pity them let them beware let their parent take heed for there is a bad streak in them nocturnal bird of prey the barnowl the horned owl the gray owl the white owl and other similar bird are known under the general name of nocturnal bird of prey they are called bird of prey because they live by hunting game of various sort especially such rodent a rat and mouse they are among bird what the cat is among mammal untiring destroyer of those furcovered creature of which the mouse is the most familiar example to you our language ha long since taken note of this resemblance in habit by coining the name chathuant hooting cat which is applied to some of these bird they are cat that fly that hoot or in other word that utter cry like mournful howl of distress also they are nocturnal that is they remain during the day in some obscure hidingplace which they leave only at nightfall to hunt in the twilight and moonlight their eye are very large and round and are placed in the front of the head instead of one on each side a wide ring of fine feather encircles each eye the need for these enormous eye is plainly seen in the bird nocturnal habit being obliged to seek their food in a very feeble light they must in order to see with any distinctness have eye that admit a much light a possible that is the eye must be such a can open wide but this development of the organ of sight so useful in the nighttime is a serious inconvenience in the bright light of day dazzled blinded by the sun ray the bird of darkness stay in some safe hole and dare not come out if obliged to issue forth it doe so with extreme caution for fear of hurting itself it wing it way with hesitation and in short slow flight other bird bird of the day seeing it uncertainty and awkwardness come and vie with one another in offering insult to the clumsy stranger the redbreast and the tomtit are among the first to hasten to the scene followed by the finch the blackbird the jay the thrush and many others perched on a branch the nightbird receives the aggressor with a grotesque balancing of it body turning it big head this way and that in a ridiculous manner and rolling it great eye a if thinking thus to terrify it persecutor but all in vain the smallest and weakest are the boldest in tormenting it they assault their victim with beak and claw pulling out it feather before the hapless bird can muster courage to defend itself just think said emile of a teasing tomtit and a saucy redbreast making sport of an owl blinded by the sun why do they behave so from motif of revenge the owl loses no opportunity to gobble up those little bird in the night and show no more compunction over it than if they were nothing but common mouse therefore what a frolic it is for the little winged people when by good luck the nightbird stray into the light of day the peck fall thick a hail on the sufferer back and it is nearly deafened with shrill scream of triumph and insulting cry of hatred the redbreast pull out a feather the tomtit threatens the enemy eye the jay overwhelms it with abuse the whole grove is in an uproar but beware when night close in then the boldest will lose courage these same saucy little bird that come in the daytime and insult the owl flee from it in wild alarm a soon a darkness allows it to move about and use it powerful talon and hooked beak the redbreast had better get out of the owl way when the owl can see said emile it would pay dearly if it tried then to pull out a feather on account of the great size of their eye nocturnal bird of prey require a soft light like that of dawn and nightfall consequently they leave their lurkingplaces to hunt for prey either soon after sunset or just before dawn then it is that their raid are most likely to be successful for they find the small animal either fast asleep or on the point of falling asleep moonlight night are the best for their purpose those are their night of veritable joy and feasting when they can hunt for hour at a time and lay in large supply of choice provision but when there is no moon they have only one scant hour in the early morning and another in the evening for hunting that mean they must fast for hour and that is why they are so greedy when they can get a much food a they want they are very silly to fast like that emile declared in their place i should hunt all night even without a moon you say that because you think the owl can see clearly in the blackest darkness but you are mistaken to see we must not merely direct our gaze toward the object to be seen we must receive into our eye the light reflected from that object in the act of seeing nothing go out from u everything come to u from the thing seen we do not really throw our glance toward any given object it is the object that throw it light toward u or if it doe not throw any light it is for that reason invisible what i am now saying about human being applies to all animal not one absolutely not one can see in the absence of light i had always thought said louis that cat could see in pitchdarkness others think so too but they are much mistaken the cat can no more distinguish object if light is totally lacking than any other creature can it ha an advantage over u i grant you it ha large eye the pupil of which it can contract and almost close when it find itself exposed to a bright light that would otherwise dazzle it or open wide to receive more of the feeble light diffused in a dark room these large eye enable it to find it way in place which to u with our poorer sight seem pitchdark but in reality the darkness is not complete where a cat can manage to see well enough for it purpose if light is totally lacking the cat may open it eye a wide a possible but it will see nothing absolutely nothing in this particular nocturnal bird do not differ from the cat their large eye made for seeing in a dim light can see nothing whatever when the night is perfectly dark now let u follow the bird in it hunt the night is a fine one for hunting the air is calm the moon shining the hunt begin with a lugubrious warcry at that dreaded signal the tomtit hardly feel safe even in the deepest hollow of it tree the redbreast tremble beneath it shelter of thick foliage and the finch loses it head with fright god of the weak god of the little bird protect them now make the owl enraged a it still is from the insult of the day miss them in it search blessed be thy holy name if the rapacious bird turn in some other direction it skirt the grove and skim over the open plain and the plowed field it inspects the furrow where the fieldmouse crouch the stretch of grassland where the mole burrow the tumbledown building in which rat and mouse scamper to and fro it flight is silent it soft wing cleaving the air without making the slightest sound to awaken it intended victim this noiselessness of flight is due to the structure of the bird feather which are soft a silk and of finest texture nothing give warning of it sudden coming the prey is seized even before it ha suspected the nearness of the enemy the owl on the contrary with it exceptional acuteness of hearing is kept informed of all that is going on in the neighborhood it large deep ear detecting even the rustle of a fieldmouse in the grass if the mouse begin to nibble a rootlet or a grain of wheat the bird hears the sound of it incisor and pounce on it immediately the prey is seized by two strong claw warmly gloved in down a far a the root of the nail each foot ha four toe three pointing habitually forward and one backward but by a privilege peculiar to nocturnal bird of prey one of the front toe is movable and can be turned back so that the set of talon is divided into two pair of equal power whenever the bird wish to grip a in a vise the branch on which it perch or the victim struggling in it grasp one blow of the beak break the head of the captured creature this beak is short and very hooked the two mandible move with great ease which enables them in striking against each other to give out a sharp rattling sound or clicking by which the bird express anger or fright they stretch wide at the moment of swallowing exposing a big opening leading into a very large gullet when they are thus opened the prey which ha already been kneaded into a compact mass between the claw disappears entirely a if swallowed up by an abyss all go down including bone and hair not a trace is left of the fieldmouse not even it coat of fur but a single victim is seldom enough and so the hunt continues more mouse follow the first one and all are first killed by a peck on the head all are swallowed whole if the bird chance upon a fat beetle he doe not disdain it it is a small mouthful to be sure but highly flavored with spice that will aid digestion at last having eaten all it possibly can the owl return to it lodging in the hollow of some rock or in a decayed tree trunk or in some ruined building now follows digestion motionless in the quiet of it peaceful solitude the bird gently close it eye to dream of the fine exploit it ha just achieved and to plan others for the following night it slumber are deep and long in the meantime the stomach doe it work the food swallowed without any preparation or sorting must be divided into two part that which is really nutritious and that which is worthless with the aid of it gastric juice the stomach carefully separate the bone and skin from the nutritious part of it content the flesh thus made semifluid disappears to be converted into blood and a confused mass remains composed of skin turned inside out and wearing all their fur bone a clean a if they had been scraped with a knife and the hard wingcovers of beetle this bulky mass could not be passed on by the stomach without danger how then will the bird get rid of it let u watch and find out ah the owl is waking up grotesque heaving of the body denote trouble within the disturbance increase something ascends through the outstretched neck the beak open and it is all over there drop to the ground a ball containing skin bone scale fur feathersin fact the entire mass of indigestible matter all nocturnal bird of prey practise this undignified method of freeing the stomach they throw up in a ball the rejected remnant of what they have swallowed whole if you ever find yourself near an owl retreat examine the ground beneath it the ball of little bone and hair will tell you from how many mouse and other rodent of all kind these bird deliver u i have seen some of those ball near a rock all white with birddung said louis some owl certainly lived there it wa responsible for the dung and the ball of refuse that you saw rat let u return for a moment to the rodent the habitual prey of the nightbird you do not know them all by any mean but we ought not to pas them by for if some like the hare and the rabbit are useful to u still more are very destructive you remember those two pair of incisor so long and sharp that i told you about when i described the rabbit teeth all rodent have similar incisor to keep them sharp and prevent them from overlapping too much by growing too long which would make it impossible for the animal to feed itself the rodent must wear them down by constant friction a fast a they grow consequently these terrible incisor have so to speak no rest they must always be nibbling something no matter what thus the harm they do u is much greater than you would suspect from the size of the animal how much actual food doe a mouse need for one meal very little unquestionably a mouse is so small that a single nut will fill it stomach dont think however that one day ravage are confined to that one nut after the nut is eaten the animal will proceed perhaps to gnaw a hole in a bag reduce a piece of cloth to tatter chew up a book or drill a hole in a board simply and solely to whet it teeth and the damage caused by rat and mouse in our dwellinghouses is matched by other damage caused by other rodent in the field you must make the acquaintance of all these destroyer for my part jules confessed i shouldnt if i saw it know the fieldmouse that you told u about in your talk on nightbird i know rat and mouse such a we have in the house said emile but thats all and yet rejoined his uncle i very much doubt whether you have any real knowledge of the rat i will begin with it the common or black rat is more than twice the size of a mouse it coat is nearly black above and ashy gray underneath it life in granary thatched roof and abandoned ruin if it fails to find a lodging to it taste it burrow a hole for itself it is not a native with u but is thought to have come from asia in the wake of the army returning from the crusade today the common rat is seldom mentioned in our country another foreign rodent ha come in the norway or brown rat which being larger than the common rat ha waged war against it and almost wiped out the specie we have not gained by the exchange quite the contrary the norway rat being a much more troublesome creature the true rat the black rat is rare now especially where the other abounds and that is why i doubt that any one of you is familiar with it what you call a rat is more than likely to be one of these norwegian invader dont forget the colorblackand you will have no difficulty in recognizing the true rat the mouse is much more familiar to you it ha been known from the earliest time all over the world need i describe this little rodent so well known for it liveliness it wily nature and it extreme timidity which make it scuttle away to it hole at the slightest alarm we all know the mouse very well jules assured him the norway or brown rat also known a the sewerrat is the largest and most troublesome of all european rat it attains a length of nearly a foot without counting the tail which is scaly like the mouse and a little shorter than the body the largest and strongest norway rat can cope with a cat it presence in europe date only from the middle of the eighteenth century and it seems to have been brought from india in the hold of ship which it commonly infests it ha now spread all over the world it coat is reddish brown above and ashy gray underneath norway rat frequent storehouse cellar sewer slaughterhouse and dumping ground everything is food to these filthy and audacious creature and they even dare to attack a sleeping man in large town they multiply so fast a to cause serious alarm the vicinity of the slaughterhouse of montfaucon in paris is so undermined with their innumerable burrow that the building there are in danger of collapsing to preserve them from this disaster it is necessary to protect their foundation against the attack of the rodent by mean of a deep enclosing belt of broken glass bottle what attracts them in such number to these place asked jules the abundance of food the dead body of slaughtered horse in one night if left in the slaughterhouse yard dead horse are devoured to the skeleton during severe frost if the skin is not removed in time the norway rat get inside the body stay there and eat all the flesh so that when a thaw come and the workman begin to skin the animal they find inside the skin nothing but a host of rat swarming among the bare bone but dont the people there have any cat to protect them asked emile cat the norway rat would eat them alive my boy in no time they have something better howeverdogs both terrier and bulldog that run the rat down in the sewer with astonishing cleverness and break their back with one bite the bulldogthats the kind of cat you need for such mouse this hunt in the sewer moreover must be frequently repeated for norway rat multiply with frightful rapidity and if we were not careful the town would sooner or later be endangered the horrible creature strong in it number would devour all paris in december of the year 1849 two hundred and fifty thousand rat were destroyed in a few day a the result of a single hunt in the country the norway rat frequents the bank of foul stream it enters kitchen through sinkhole it get into henhouse and rabbitwarrens by undermining the wall it haunt cellar and stable but rarely make it way into high granary doubtless because of it liking for filthy drainage and any kind of offal which can be found only on ground floor and in basement it pounce upon egg and young fowl and even ha the boldness to suck the blood of fullgrown poultry and rabbit when it can not get animal food which is it first choice it will eat grain and vegetable of all kind no sort of food is rejected by this filthy glutton to get rid of it you can hardly count on the cat for usually pussy is afraid to attack it nor are nightbird strong enough to battle with it except the eagleowl which doe not abound in any number the trap and poison are our only remaining mean of overcoming this redoubtable foe the fieldmouse is a little larger than the ordinary mouse it coat which closely resembles that of the norway rat is reddish brown above and white underneath it eye are large and prominent it ear nearly black and it foot white it tail which is very long like that of the common mouse is thinly covered with hair and is black toward the end the fieldmouse frequents wood hedge field and garden it cut down the stalk of grain to get at the ear of which it nibble a few kernel and wastefully scatter the rest in it quest for food it unearths newly planted seed take a taste of the young shoot that have just come up gnaws the bark of shrub and feast on growing vegetable it ravage are all the more serious because it lay up provision against a time of need in storage chamber more than a foot underground beneath some tree trunk or rock it collect grain hazelnut acorn almond and chestnut often going a considerable distance to get them one such storeroom is not enough it must have several for it ha a way of foolishly forgetting where it treasure is buried in winter the fieldmouse venture to approach our house and make it way into our cellar where fruit and vegetable are kept or it establishes itself in great number in our granary the dwarf rat or harvestmouse is the smallest rodent of france it is a graceful creature smaller than the common mouse and of a yellowish tawny color which is brighter on the rump than elsewhere but the belly breast and throat are a beautiful white and the tail and foot a light yellow the ear which stand out but very little beyond the fur of the head are rounded and hairy and the eye are prominent the dwarf rat life exclusively in grainfield and feed on grain after the harvest it take refuge in the stack of grain especially in oatstacks but is never bold enough to enter house i am telling you about this pretty little rodent not so much because i begrudge it the few grain of oat it steal from u a because i wish to acquaint you with it nest other rat rear their young either in a hole in a rock or a wall or in a burrow dug for the purpose the harvestmouse however scorn these stifling quarter it must have an aërial nest like that built by bird so it brings together several wheatstalks a they stand in the field interlaces them with bit of straw and build halfway up from the ground a nest a beautifully made a any bird this nest is spherical interwoven with leaf on the outside and padded with moss on the inside it ha only one little side opening through which the rain can not enter suspended at the height of several foot on the flexible support of the grain stalk it swing to and fro with the slightest wind how then asked emile doe the little mouse manage to get in and out of it nest it climb up one of the stalk being so small that this serf it perfectly a a ladder if i ever come across a harvestmouse i shant have the heart to do it any harm it may go on eating oat in it pretty little nest for all i care i shant try to stop it here concluded uncle paul i will end my account of the chief representative of the rat family in these region they are five in number the black rat the mouse the norway rat the fieldmouse and the harvestmouse meadowmice 3hamstersdormice another kind of rodent now call for our attention it is the family of meadowmice commonly confounded with rat meadowmice are easily recognized by their short slightly hairy tail the meadowmouse is about a large a a common mouse it coat is of a yellowish hue mixed with gray above and dirty white underneath the tail is only onequarter a long a the body the eye are large and prominent the ear rounded hairy and standing out but little from the fur the head is large and le pointed than that of the ordinary mouse in it rapid and abundant breeding the meadowmouse is one of the farmer chief foe it overrun grainfield especially cutting down the stalk to nibble the ear after harvest it attack clover root carrot potato and the product in general of our kitchengardens in winter it dig under the furrow to eat the seed sown there if the soil is so frostbound a not to permit it to reach the buried seed it retires to the stack of grain where it doe great damage it never make it way into our dwelling meadowmice appear to emigrate from one country to another in colony when the country they have ravaged can no longer supply them with food at any rate from time to time once or twice in a decade they suddenly appear in countless drove that are a real scourge to the country visited the best destroyer of these creature are nocturnal bird of prey a is proved by the presence of their skull bone and skin in the ball that are thrown up by these bird after digestion some say diurnal bird of prey buzzard in particular are equally fond of them it is not at all uncommon to find in a buzzard crop a many a ten or more meadowmice the underground meadowmouse is much le common in france than the one just described from which it differs in it grayandblackish coat it somewhat smaller tail and it tiny eye but the greatest difference is in it habit the firstmentioned life in the field especially in grainfield while the second frequents meadow and kitchengardens it feed on various kind of vegetable such a celery artichoke carrot potato and cardoon it seldom show itself out of it underground tunnel and on account of it habit of lurking beneath the surface it is called the underground meadowmouse the amphibian meadowmouse is commonly known by the name of waterrat we can easily tell it from the black rat which is of about the same size by it red coat it short tail which is not quite half the length of it body and it larger and le pointed head it burrow under the bank of stream ditch and marsh where it feed chiefly on root but doe not disdain small fish when it can catch them it is a good swimmer and diver sometimes it make it way into kitchengardens where it doe the same sort of harm a the underground meadowmouse and into orchard where it gnaws the base of young tree the lemming is never seen around here it frequents the coast of the arctic ocean in norway and lapland i will tell you something about it on account of it curious way of traveling from one country to another of which our meadowmouse offer u a far le striking example the lemming with it very short and hairy tail it big head and it stocky body ha the appearance of a small rabbit it coat is red marbled with black and brown at the approach of severe cold weather and sometimes with no apparent reason the lemming leave their haunt in the high mountain chain of norway and set out on a long journey toward the sea the emigrating horde composed of myriad of individual trot in a straight line over all obstacle never allowing themselves to be turned from their course in traveling in a line one after another say linnæus the great swedish naturalist they trace straight parallel furrow two or three finger deep and several ell apart they devour everything eatable that obstructs their passage all root and herbage nothing turn them from their course let a man appear in their path and they slip between his leg if they come to a haystack they gnaw a tunnel through it reaching a rock they skirt it in a semicircle and then resume their original direction should a lake be encountered on their route they swim across it in a straight line however wide it may be if a boat is in their way in the middle of a body of water they clamber over it and jump into the water again on the other side a swiftly flowing river doe not stop them they plunge into the foaming current even if they all perish they must be very obstinate said emile to prefer to drown rather than turn their procession out of a straight line animal sometimes show these example of obstinacy which we can not understand but which might easily be explained if we knew the motif that make them act thus perhaps by deviating from a straight line the lemming might lose their way a way provided with no fingerpost but indicated simply by instinct however we will leave them to pursue their long pilgrimage from which few will return so numerous are the danger and the enemy awaiting them on the way let them cross their river and lake while we return to the rodent of france the hamster abounds in central europe notably in alsace it is also called the strasbourg marmot or rye pig it is almost a large a the black rat but is more stocky it tail is short and hairy it fur red on the back black under the belly with yellowish spot on the flank a white spot on the throat and another on each shoulder hamster live on root fruit and especially cereal of which they store up a large supply each animal dig a burrow composed of several room the largest of which is used a a granary there they store rye and wheat bean and pea vetch and linseed the hamster hoard like a miser laying up far more than it will ever need simply for the satisfaction of hoarding in some of it storeroom a much a two hundredweight of provision may be found what can a creature no bigger than your fist do with all these supply winter come and the hamster shuts itself up in it underground quarter assured of food and lodging and grows big and fat if the cold is very severe it go to sleep like the marmot and what about the two hundredweight of grain collected a kernel at a time queried emile the whole supply simply spoil and is so much waste but little doe the hamster care he begin all over again the next year the animal special business is first and foremost to ravage field a is proved by the pile of grain it store up out of all proportion to it need it hoard food to destroy it far more than to be sure of something to eat being very different in this way from most hibernating animal in the midst of all it store of food if the winter is very cold it is overtaken by the same torpor that save the hedgehog and the bat from death by starvation this miser ha not even the excuse of want happy are those region that it doe not rob let u pas on to other rodent there are then still more of these greedy animal jules inquired yes they are somewhat like insect after they are all gone there are still some left the world seems to be a pasture delivered over to the mandible of larvæ and the incisor of rodent dormouse of many variety live in the wood and orchard and eat fruit these rodent have the agility elegance of form and rich fur of squirrel they make their home in hollow tree trunk hole in wall and cranny in rock during the winter when fruit is lacking they remain in a deep sleep the dormouse proper is found in provence and roussillon it is a pretty creature reminding one of the squirrel it tail is long and thickly covered with hair it fur ashy brown on the back and whitish under the belly at night it ravage the fruittrees and no one know better how to pick out the pear the peach or the plum at just the right stage of ripeness you have let u suppose looked over your fruit with satisfaction and decided to give it one more day of sunshine to bring it to perfection the next morning you go out to gather the harvest and lo and behold it is gone the dormouse ha been there before you the garden dormouse is smaller being about a large a the black rat it coat is a pleasing mixture of red white and black the back being red the belly paw cheek and shoulder white and the part about the eye and down the side of the neck black this animal is scattered all over france it lurks about dwelling in garden and among vine and shrubbery living chiefly on fruit which it ruin in great quantity tasting first one choice specimen and then another without finishing any of them garden dormouse spend the winter several in one hole where they sleep all curled up amid the supply of walnut almond and hazelnut that they have laid up then if they sleep said emile they dont need any food pardon me my boy they do need food and badly though not while sleeping but when they wake up this awakening take place at the beginning of spring when the sun is first warming up the earth at that time of year there is no fruit to be had and the garden dormouse after their fast of several month have a tremendous appetite a you can easily imagine what would become of them now poor little thing if it were not for their supply of nut those little dormouse are very prudent emile remarked they know that at the end of their long winter sleep they wont find any fruit in the orchard and so they lay up provision beforehand but why dont they put by apple and pear if they are so fond of them because apple and pear would spoil whereas almond and hazelnut keep very well thats so i hadnt thought of that but the little dormouse had no it doe not think of it either it doe not know that pear spoil and nut keep because it ha never tried to keep pear it doe not foresee that when it wake up the fruittrees will not be bearing fruit will hardly have their first leaf it doe not know how long it would have to wait to find a pear to nibble it know nothing of all these thing which it is now about to become aware of perhaps for the first time through experience some one else think for the dormouse and give it the prudence to store up nut in a hole in the wall some one who understands foresees and know everything and that some one is god the father of the man who plant the peartree and father also of the little dormouse that is so fond of pear horned owl we have glanced in a cursory way at a number of our rodent that are harmful to crop i pas over in silence the pretty squirrel a lover of walnut and beechnut and the industrious beaver an animal which may still be found here and there along the rhone the hare and the rabbit too i willingly give over to the hunter rifle what protection have we from the devouring hunger of the othersthe rat the fieldmouse and the meadowmice how are we to hold them in check in our home we have the cat outside we have the army of feathered catsthe nocturnal bird of prey i will divide these latter into two class to make it easier to distinguish the various specie one ha the head adorned with two tuft of feathersplumicorns is the term sometimes usedwhile the other class lack this ornament horned owl come under the first classification hornless owl or those that may be called simply owl come under the second the largest of the horned owl is the eagleowl it can easily be recognized say buffon by it burly form it enormous head it large and cavernous ear the two egret surmounting it head to a height of more than two inch and a half it short hooked beak black in color it great clear eye with their fixed gaze and large black pupil encircled by an orangecolored ruff of feather and it face surrounded by hairsor rather little rudimentary white feather bordering a ring of other little feather that are curledalso by it black hooked claw of great strength it very short neck it reddish brown plumage spotted with black and yellow on the back it foot covered with thick down and reddish feather to the very root of the nail and finally it hairraising cry of wheehoo hoohoo hoohoo poohoo which it sends forth in the silence of the night when all the rest of the world is still then it is that it awakens it intended victim fill them with vague alarm pursues and catch them and carry them off to the cavern where it ha it hidingplace it life among the rock or in old deserted tower in the mountain rarely descending into the plain and never willingly perching on tree but rather on the roof of some sequestered church or ancient castle it favorite prey consists of young hare little rabbit fieldmouse and rat of which it digest the fleshy substance and throw up the hair bone and skin in round ball the eagleowl make it nest in some rocky cave or in a hole in some lofty old wall it nest is nearly three foot in diameter and is made of small dry branch interwoven with flexible root and padded with leaf inside only one or two or rarely a many a three egg are found in this nest in color they somewhat resemble the bird plumage and in size they are larger than hen egg those two thing like horn that the eagleowl ha on it headare they ear asked emile no my boy they are egret upstanding feather that give the bird a warlike appearance it ear are not visible being hidden by the plumage they are very large and deep which explains why the eagleowls hearing is so wonderfully acute the eagleowl louis here observed eats fieldmouse and rat for which it is to be thanked but it also eats young hare and young rabbit isnt that a pity for the hunter i admit but for the farmer it is quite another thing dont forget that the hare and the rabbit belong to the order of rodent they have incisor which spare nothing in the field if they were left to breed in peace they would prove a serious menace to our crop history tell of country so ravaged by rabbit that it became necessary to send an army to help the inhabitant get rid of them we shall never reach that condition i am sure but it is no cause for regret that the eagleowl jointly with the hunter keep the animal within tolerable bound moreover the bird is very scarce everywhere one pair of these bird in a year is the most that you will find in the mountain about here an extensive huntingground is required by such big eater if they are not to starve one another out i have a more serious complaint to bring against the eagleowl when it can not find it favorite gamemeadowmice fieldmouse and ratsit content itself with bat snake toad lizard and frog and thus deprives u of some of our best protector be assured once for all that while we have some irreproachable helper there are also others that from our point of view are guilty of a good many misdeed bear in mind the mole which throw up the earth and cut the root of plant in it war on insect no animal give a moment thought to manexcept the dog who is our friend even more than he is our servant no other pay any heed to our interest all work for themselves and their young if their instinct prompt them to destroy only specie harmful to u so much the better they are excellent helper but if they hunt both harmful and helpful specie we must balance the total good against the total harm that they do if the good tip the scale let u respect the animal it is a helper if it doe more harm than good let u declare war on the creature it is a ravager the eagleowl catch in the field such formidable hoarder of grain a fieldmouse and hamster in garden dormouse and other lover of fruit in the neighborhood of our house ordinary mouse and rat and even the horrible norway rat there you have the plea for the defendant on the other hand the hunter charge the bird with killing a certain number of young rabbit incautiously taking a taste or two of wild thyme by moonlight and with appropriating a few young hare that would otherwise be eaten by human being for my part i accuse it of feeding it young on the serviceable toad the useful snake and the cricketeating lizard there you have the prosecutor charge but the balance being struck the bird service are found to outweigh it misdeed and i declare that the eagleowl deserves well of the farmer it is a unanimous verdict declared jules the common horned owl or lesser eagleowl uncle paul continued is much like the bird we have been discussing only it is far smaller being very little larger than a crow while the other is the size of a goose it is the commonest of all the nocturnal bird of prey in these region in the night hour throughout the summer it keep repeating in melancholy accent it longdrawn and doleful cry of cloocloo which can be heard a long way off just a it take flight it give a sort of bitter sigh made no doubt by the air expelled from it lung by the effort of the wing at the moment of flying off in the daytime confronted by human being this bird wear a dazed and foolish expression it snap it beak stamp it foot and move it big head abruptly up and down and from side to side if attacked by too strong an enemy it lie down on it back and threatens it foe with claw and beak it inhabits ruined building cave in rock and the hollow trunk of old tree seldom doe it take the trouble to build a nest of it own preferring to patch up one that ha been deserted by a magpie or a buzzard there it lay four or five round white egg i will remark in passing that the egg of nocturnal bird of prey are not oval like hen egg but more nearly round the hunting habit of the horned owl are like those of the eagleowl it ha the same liking for rodent such a fieldmouse rat ordinary mouse and meadowmice it pounce upon young rabbit in the same manner after patiently watching for them at the mouth of the burrow now let u pas on to another specie the shorthorned owl or large sparrowowl resembles the lesser eagleowl in plumage and size the two egret or plumicorns are very short and they seldom stand erect a in the two preceding specie because of the shortness of these horn the large sparrowowl is often taken for a hornless owl this specie is seldom seen near dwellinghouses preferring rock quarry and ruined and solitary castle it build no nest but is content to lay in a hole in some wall or rock two or three white egg shiny and round and about a large a pigeon egg it usual cry is goo uttered rather softly but if rain is coming the cry is changed to goyoo it diet is mostly confined to fieldmouse and meadowmice the red owl is of about the blackbird size it plumage is ashy gray mottled with red and marked with little fleck of black running lengthwise and fine gray line running around the body it is the smallest and prettiest of our nocturnal bird of prey when it fine egret stand up well on the forehead they give it a bold and martial air that go well with it eagerness for the chase in the picture emile pointed out it horn are not standing up no the bird is represented in one of it peaceful moment there is nothing to arouse it nothing to attract it attention it ha withdrawn into itself and is thinking of the fine feast it had when it last went hunting it is digesting that feast but let a mouse come and scratch anywhere near and the red owl immediately ruffle it foreheadthe first sign of attention it straightens up and spread out it egretsa sign of the closest possible attention it ha heard it ha understood off dart the bird and the mouse is caught the smaller rodent are it delight it season them with beetle and junebugsespecially the latter which are an aid to digestion when larger game is lacking it content itself with a frugal meal of insect hoping to make up for it soon with a good dinner of meadowmice red owl are great traveler they assemble in company sometimes to migrate for the winter and seek a warmer clime sometimes to search out a district where there is plenty of game when their present haunt no longer offer enough to suffice them if fieldmouse are on the increase in some particular region and are ravaging the field of grain and hay the red owl hear of it i dont know how they spread the glad tidings all club together and start for the land where feasting awaits them with such zeal do they apply themselves to the work of extermination that in a few week the field are cleared of the infesting horde red owl nest in hollow tree and cleft in rock their egg from two to four in a nest are of a shiny white other owl owl not belonging to the horned class lack of course the egret or plumicorns characteristic of the latter the largest of the hornless owl is the howlet or tawny owl which is about a large a one of our domestic hen the predominating color of it plumage is grayish in the male and reddish in the female a difference that sometimes cause them to be mistaken for separate specie on this background color is a sprinkling of light brown spot running lengthwise of the body and le numerous on the breast and stomach than elsewhere the wing are marked with several large white round spot the head is very large and nearly round the face sunken in the surrounding feather and partly concealed by them the eye likewise sunken are brown and surrounded with small gray feather the name howlet is connected in it derivation with the word howl and the bird called by that name is indeed remarkable for it cry not unlike a wolf howl when at the close of a somber winter day the wind whip the snow and moan in the tree one may often hear a frightful cry prolonged and mournful rising from the dark depth of the foresthoohoo hoohoo hoohoo then in the lonely cottage the frightened mother make the sign of the cross while her little one press close to her cry and saying the wolf are coming dont be uneasy good people it is not a wolf it is an owl hoohooing sounding it warcry from the top of some hollow oak and getting ready for it nightly round in summertime the howlet life in the wood it hunt by preference fieldmouse and meadowmice which it swallow whole afterward throwing up the skin and bone rolled into a ball the little bird that worry it so unmercifully in the daytime whenever they get a chance to come upon it unawares in the sunlight are not safe from it beak in the hour of darkness if the nightbird can pounce upon them after first frightening them with it terrible hoohoo keep a still a mouse in your hidingplaces you finch and redbreast and tomtit and dont betray yourselves by giving voice to your alarm let the owl hoohoo a much a it plea if you make a sound you are lost if the field prove disappointing a a huntingground the owl make bold to approach dwellinghouses and find it way into barn there to play the part of cat and thus make good the title of hooting cat which ha been given it for patience and skill in catching rat and mouse it rival raminagrobis 4 himself it is a guest to be treated with respect when hunger compels it to visit our granary after completing it nightly round it return to the wood early in the morning hide in the densest thicket or in the tree having the most abundant foliage and there pass the day silent and motionless in winter it home is always in the hollow of some old tree trunk it lay it egg in the abandoned nest of magpie crow buzzard and kestrel and these egg of a dingy gray color are about a large a a pullet but nearly round the belfryowl also known a the barnowl is an ungainly bird rather smaller than the howlet it plumage however is not wanting in elegance being red on the back sprinkled with gray and brown and prettily dotted with white point alternating with dark one and white underneath with or without brown spot the eye are deepset and each is encircled by a ring of fine white feather almost like hair a little collar bordered with red frame the face the beak is whitish and the claw are covered only with a soft white down very short under which the pink flesh can be seen this bird ha none of the proud bearing of the eagleowl and the red owl it carry itself awkwardly with an embarrassed almost shamefaced look humpbacked and with wing hanging down face sad and scowling and leg long and ungainlysuch is the barnowls appearance in repose a if to complete it ungraceful attitude the bird whenever anything disturbs it teeter from side to side in a ludicrous fashion with haggard eye and wing slightly raised and what is the teetering for asked jules no doubt to frighten it enemy in time of danger the barnowl utters a harsh grating crycraa craa craawhich often frightens away the enemy the owl habitual cry in the silence of the night is a mournful heavy breathing not unlike the snoring of a man sleeping with his mouth open to these cry add the darkness of the night the near neighborhood of church and cemetery and you will understand how the innocent barnowl ha managed to frighten child woman and even men you will be able to see why it ha the reputation of being a funeral bird the bird of death summoning to the cemetery one of the person living in the house it visit the french name effraie fright ha reference to these superstitious terror it designates the bird that frightens with it nightly chant those who are foolish enough to believe in ghost and sorcerer it may practise it chant on our roof a much a it like jules declared boldly it wont scare me a bit nor would it scare any one else if everybody would listen to reason instead of putting faith in ridiculous story fear like cruelty is the daughter of ignorance train your reason accustom yourselves to see thing a they really are and foolish fear will be banished the barnowl also go by the name of belfryowl because it like to make it home in old church tower sometimes it will enter a church by night to hunt mouse those who first came upon the illfamed bird near the altar did not fail to accuse it of drinking oil from the lamp or rather of eating it when it is congealed by the cold the charge itself prof it own falsity a oil can not congeal in a lamp that is always kept burning but the slanderer do not trouble themselves about a little thing like that when they wish to blacken the bird reputation they will continue for a long time if not forever to regard the owl a a profaner of holy lamp in provence they will always call this bird the oildrinker in reality the barnowl life on rat and mouse which it catch in barn and church on fieldmouse meadowmice and dormouse which it hunt in garden and field here beyond a doubt we have a service rendered that ought to make people forget it false reputation make them like and protect it a it deserves will the bird that give u very real help and is guiltless of a single offense ever be declared innocent i very much doubt it superstition is so deeprooted that there will never be lacking a oneeyed john to nail a live owl to his door the barnowl like to live in inhabited region the roof of church summit of steeple high towersthese are it favorite haunt all day it remains crouching in some dark hole from which it doe not come out until after sunset it manner of taking flight deserves mention first it let itself fall from the summit of it steeple like a dead weight and it doe not spread it wing until after a rather long vertical drop it then pursues a zigzag course making no more noise than if the wind bore it along it is fond of nesting in abandoned ruin in the hollow trunk of wormeaten tree occasionally in barn high up on some beam but it build no nest to hold it egg which are laid on the spot that may have been selected with no leaf root or hair to serve a bedding the laying take place toward the end of march and is limited to five or six white egg remarkable for their oval shape an exceptional shape for nocturnal bird of prey the little one with their large eye beak stretched open for food and rumpled down are the ugliest creature imaginable the mother feed them with insect and bit of mouseflesh the smallest of our hornless owl is the sparrowowl like the red owl it is about the size of a blackbird it is dark brown in color with large white spot of a round or oval shape the throat is white and the tail is crossed by four narrow whitish stripe the sparrowowl ha a quick and light bearing and it see by day much better than other night bird therefore it sometimes chase small bird but rarely with success when it ha the good luck to catch one it pluck it very clean before eating it instead of following the gluttonous example of the horned owl and the howlet which swallow such prey whole and throw the feather up later it hunting expedition are much more fruitful when directed against fieldmouse and common mouse which it dismembers before eating other owl make but one mouthful of their prey the sparrowowl tear to piece the animal it ha caught perhaps so that it may enjoy the flavor more to express astonishment surprise fear the barnowl waddle in a most ridiculous manner but the sparrowowl adopts another method it bow it leg crouch down and then abruptly rise lengthening it neck and turning it head to right and left you would say it wa moved by spring from within this performance is repeated over and over again each time accompanied by a clacking of the beak in flight the bird habitual cry is poo poo poo at rest it say aymay aidmay repeated several time in quick succession in a tone almost human the sparrowowl life in deserted building quarry old and dilapidated tower but never in hollow tree it frequents the roof of church and of village house it nest consists of a hole in a rock or a wall where it lay four or five round white egg somewhat speckled with red the eagle if it were my purpose to give you a systematic and scientific account of bird instead of acquainting you with the various specie useful to agriculture i ought to have begun with bird that hunt by day and to have postponed my talk on those that hunt by night in other word the eagle the falcon and the hawk should have been described first but should you ask me why i should be rather at a loss for a satisfactory answer for want of a better let u content ourselves with this one the first do their work by day the second at night but the eagle and the others of that group live at our expense while the horned owl and it kind render u a great service by holding in check what would else be a disastrous multiplication of rodent consequently in point of usefulness the nightbird come first but this is contrary to all usage both scientific and popular which put the eagle first in the list of bird do we not say of the eagle that it is the king of bird why ha this title been given to the fierce bandit the murderer of lamb i should be puzzled to answer this question did i not know man inclination to glorify brute strength even though he himself may be it victim you my child will find that out only too soon to your sorrow plunder on a grand scale appeal ala to something in our faulty human nature that make u excuse it nay more that make u glorify it whereas productive toil useful to all leaf u cold or even disdainful the falcon is a ravisher of our henhouse a bloodthirsty marauder of our dovecote and we hold it in high esteem calling it a noble bird shall we then never learn to judge animal and men by their true worth their real usefulness let u hope that a so many fine mind have worked are working and always will work to bring about this miracle you my child will some day follow their example work for this end with all your power and blessing be upon you if you succeed in giving some additional strength however little it may be to this common effort put forth by all men of light and leading i shall discus but briefly the bird of prey whose activity are confined to the daylight hour they are nearly all bandit nothing else living at our cost by robbery and murder from the fact that they hunt by day never at night they are called diurnal or day bird of prey the brightest light doe not dazzle them it is even said of the eagle and others of this class that they can look straight at the sun and this is credited to them a an added title of nobility but there is no great merit in this performance when once you know how they shade their eye in accomplishing it they have three eyelid to each eye first two like ours an upper and a lower which close in sleep and then a third which is semitransparent and is withdrawn completely into the corner of the eye when the bird ha no use for it but when needed come out from under the other two which remain open and serf a a curtain if the light is too bright or the bird wish to look toward the sun it ha merely to draw over the eye this third eyelid this eyeshade through the semitransparency of which the ray of light enter the pupil in a much subdued intensity there you have the whole secret of the eagle bold look in facing the sun i could do a much if i shaded my eye with a curtain emile declared all these bird are furnished with a very strong beak having hooked mandible for dismembering their prey their claw are composed of four separate talon to each foot three of these talon pointing forward and one backward the talon are long recurved and grooved on the under side the groove having sharp edge that they may the better cut into flesh the eagle bearing is bold it look stern and it flight marvelously powerful eagle like to circle about in the air to soar with scarcely a movement of the wing in the upper region of the atmosphere beyond our view nevertheless even from this immense height they can distinguish what is taking place on the earth surface below they explore every farm with their piercing eye and inspect every poultryyard let a suitable prey show itself and instantly the bird swoop down with whistling wing faster than lead would fall the unwary fowl is snatched from under the farmer very eye fortunately the eagle the chief of these bandit is a very rare bird in form it is large measuring a meter and more from the tip of the beak to the tip of the tail and it is covered with brown plumage it extended wing measure a span of nearly three meter it fierce eye overshadowed by a very prominent eyebrow glow with a somber fire the eagle nest is known a it aery and is flat instead of bowlshaped like other bird nest it is a sort of solid floor made of interwoven twig and covered with a bed of rush and heather it is commonly placed on the face of some steep and forbidding precipice and between two rock the upper one of which overhang and form a kind of roof for the nest the egg two in numbersometimes though rarely threeare of a dingy white spotted with red the young eaglet are so greedy that at the time of their rearing the aery is strewn with bit of bleeding flesh some neighboring ledge of rock serf the parent a slaughterhouse and cuttingup bench it is there that the hare and rabbit partridge and duck lamb and kid seized in the plain and carried in rapid flight to the lofty height where the eagle make it home are torn to piece in order to be fed to the everhungry eaglet is the eagle really strong enough asked emile to carry off a lamb like that i had heard it but couldnt believe it nothing is le open to doubt his uncle assured him it would carry you off if it found you alone in the mountain i could defend myself with a stick possibly but let me tell you an incident one of many to be found in the page of an author whose word we may believe two little girl one five year old the other three were playing together when a mediumsized eagle suddenly swooped down upon the elder and despite her companion cry and in the very face of some workman who came hurrying to the spot snatched her up into the air two month later a shepherd found on a rock half a league distant the body of the child half devoured and dried up what do you think now of the eagle the king of bird i think it a brigand of the worst kind affirmed jules would you like to see an eagle in the act of hunting witness it fierce joy when it buries it hooked talon in the quivering flesh of it prey then listen to this fine passage from the pen of that ardent lover of bird audubon the scene is laid far from here in america and the eagle belongs to a different specie from ours but never mind the way of these bandit are the same everywhere to give you some idea of the nature of this bird permit me to place you on the mississippi on which you may float gently along while approaching winter brings million of waterfowl on whistling wing from the country of the north to seek a milder climate in which to sojourn for a season the eagle is seen perched in an erect attitude on the highest summit of the tallest tree by the margin of the broad stream his glistening but stern eye look over the vast expanse he listens attentively to every sound that come to his quick ear from afar glancing now and then on the earth beneath lest even the light tread of the fawn may pas unheard his mate is perched on the opposite side and should all be tranquil and silent warns him by a cry to continue patient at this well known call the male partly open his broad wing incline his body a little downwards and answer to her voice in tone not unlike the laugh of a maniac the next moment he resume his erect attitude and again all around is silent duck of many specie the teal the wigeon the mallard and others are seen passing with great rapidity and following the course of the current but the eagle heed them not they are at that time beneath his attention the next moment however the wild trumpetlike sound of a yet distant but approaching swan is heard a shriek from the female eagle come across the streamfor she is a fully on the alert a her mate the latter suddenly shake the whole of his body and with a few touch of his bill aided by the action of his cuticular muscle arranges his plumage in an instant the snowwhite bird is now in sight her long neck is stretched forward her eye is on the watch vigilant a that of her enemy her large wing seem with difficulty to support the weight of her body although they flap incessantly so irksome do her exertion seem that her very leg are spread beneath her tail to aid her in her flight she approach however the eagle ha marked her for his prey a the swan is passing the dreaded pair the male bird in full preparation for the chase start from his perch with an awful scream that to the swan ear brings more terror than the report of the large duckgun now is the moment to witness the display of the eagle power he glide through the air like a falling star and like a flash of lightning come upon the timorous quarry which now in agony and despair seek by various manœuvres to elude the grasp of his cruel talon it mount double and willingly would plunge into the stream were it not prevented by the eagle which long possessed of the knowledge that by such a stratagem the swan might escape him force it to remain in the air by attempting to strike it with his talon from beneath the hope of escape is soon given up by the swan it ha already become much weakened and it strength fails at the sight of the courage and swiftness of it antagonist it last gasp is about to escape when the ferocious eagle strike with his talon the under side of it wing and with unresisted power force the bird to fall in a slanting direction upon the nearest shore it is then reader that you may see the cruel spirit of this dreaded enemy of the feathered race whilst exulting over his prey he for the first time breathes at ease he press down his powerful foot and drive his sharp claw deeper than ever into the heart of the dying swan he shriek with delight a he feel the last convulsion of his prey which ha now sunk under his unceasing effort to render death a painfully felt a it can possibly be the female ha watched every movement of her mate and if she did not assist him in capturing the swan it wa not from want of will but merely that she felt full assurance that the power and courage of her lord were quite sufficient for the deed she now sail to the spot where he eagerly awaits her and when she ha arrived they together turn the breast of the luckless swan upwards and gorge themselves with gore 5 poor swan wa emile pitying comment hawk and falcon what are we to do with enemy like the eagle asked louis when uncle paul had finished audubon account of that bird fierce and destructive rapacity destroy them wa the reply destroy them by every possible mean for we can count on no assistance from other than human helper eagle are the tyrant of the air and no other bird dare attack them the destruction of their nest is the surest way to put an end to the ravage they from time to time commit among our flock but it is an enterprise not without danger to make one way to the eagle aery and wring the neck of the young bird the shepherd of the pyrenees go about this work in couple one armed with a doublebarreled rifle and the other with a long pike at daybreak when the eagle is already away hunting the two nestdestroyers climb to the top of the steep declivity where the aery is situated the first man the one armed with the rifle post himself on the rocky summit to fire at the eagle if it return while the second his pike fastened to his belt clamber down from rock to rock to the aery and remove the eaglet which are still too young to offer serious resistance but at their first cry of distress the mother hastens to the rescue and hurl herself furiously at her enemy who receives her with blow of his pike until his comrade brings her down with a wellaimed shot the male until then soaring among the cloud now descends like a thunderbolt and is on the hunter head before the man ha time to use his pike fortunately a second bullet from the rifleman stationed above break the bird wing what if he had missed the bird asked jules then it would have been all over with his companion his face torn by the eagle beak and his eye pecked out he would have fallen to the foot of the precipice a mangled corpse no it is hardly a holiday diversion to go birdnesting among the haunt of the eagle im sure i shouldnt care to undertake it wa juless comment next to the eagle the goshawk is the largest of our diurnal bird of prey it is a magnificent creature about the size of a wellgrown rooster brown above and white underneath with numerous little dark stripe running around the body the eye is adorned with a white eyebrow the beak is blueblack and the foot are yellow the goshawk is the scourge of pigeoncotes for which reason it is also called the pigeon falcon it selects for itself a lofty perch on some tall tree and there keep a watchful eye on the flock of pigeon foraging in the field woe betide the luckless one that forgets for a moment to be on it guard the bird pounce upon it in oblique flight almost skimming the surface of the ground and in le than no time the pigeon is seized and carried off to some lonely rock where the ravisher pluck it feather and tear it to piece while still warm if the farmer is not on the lookout the goshawk attack the poultry and doe great harm at the mere appearance of the bird shadow the rooster raise a cry of alarm and the little chicken hastily take refuge under their mother wing while she her feather ruffled and her eye blazing sometimes succeeds in frightening off the enemy by her show of boldness for lack of pigeon and barnyard fowl the goshawk hunt young hare squirrel and small bird and in time of famine it will even eat mole and mouse wooded mountain are it favorite abode and it build it nest in the tallest oak and beech it egg four or five in number are slightly red or bluish and spotted with brown the common sparrowhawk is about a large a a magpie it plumage somewhat resembles the goshawk being ashy blue on the back and white underneath with brown stripe running crosswise the throat and breast are reddish and the tail is barred with six or seven dark band the leg and claw are of a beautiful yellow and are long and slender the sparrowhawk is a hunter of pigeon which it try to catch off guard by flying around the pigeoncote and by watching from the concealment of some treetop the lark the thrush and the quail often fall into it clutch it flight is low and oblique like the goshawk the wing of both being too short and too rounded at the tip to permit of lofty flight or sudden charge the young just out of the nest and a yet inexperienced in the cunning of the chase are for a while trained by the parent bird for the career they are to follow and indeed it is no rare occurrence to see the whole family hunting in company the sparrowhawk nest in tall tree and lay four or five white egg ornamented with brown spot which are larger and more numerous toward the big end of the egg both the goshawk and the sparrowhawk when they are attacked by an enemy stronger than themselves do a the horned owl doe they lie on their back and brandish their claw of all our diurnal bird of prey falcon are the most courageous and the best equipped for flying a a distinctive characteristic they have a sharp tooth on each side of the tip of the beak which itself is very powerful and curve downward in a notable manner from the very outset their wing are pointed at the tip and when folded they extend beyond or at least a far a the end of the tail all falcon soar in their flight when hunting to this class belong the common falcon the hobby and the merlin the common falcon which is a large a a hen can be recognized by a sort of mustache or black spot it ha on each cheek it back is of a dark ashen hue crossed by narrow stripe of a still deeper shade the throat and breast are pure white with black marking running lengthwise the stomach and thigh are light gray tinged with blue and striped with black and the tail show alternate stripe of dingy white and of black the beak is blue with a black tip and the eye and leg are a beautiful yellow but it should be added that the plumage of the common falcon varies a good deal with age and not until the bird is three or four year old doe it agree with the description i have just given the summit of the wildest and loftiest crag are the falcon home whence it go forth to hunt pigeon quail partridge chicken and duck it rise and soar some time in the air searching for it victim and then swoop down upon them like a missile hurled from the sky with astonishing boldness it make it way into the farmer pigeoncotes and chase the pigeon themselves under the very eye of passersby in the middle of crowded street it will even snatch partridge from before the hunter rifle and from under the huntingdogs nose it cry is strong and piercing and it fly unwearied at the rate of twenty league an hour for hundred of league but it walk is jerky and awkward because it hooked claw furnished with long and recurved nail rest insecurely on the ground the falcon nest on the southern face of rocky precipice the nest itself being clumsily built and holding three or four egg of a reddish hue spotted with brown the hobby is smaller than the common falcon it is brown above and whitish beneath with thigh and the lower part of the stomach red it boldness is equaled only by the falcon for it give chase to lark and quail even when the hunter is in the act of shooting them and dash into the midst of the fowler net to seize the decoy bird it perch on tall tree and nest in their branch it egg are whitish with a few red spot the merlin is the smallest of the diurnal bird of prey being scarcely larger than a thrush it is brown on the back and whitish with brown spot underneath it nest which is seldom found in our part of the country is built in the hollow of a rock and contains five or six whitish egg marbled at the larger end with brown and dingy green despite it smallness it is a bold bandit little bird are terrorstricken at the mere sound of the merlin wing in their neighborhood even the partridge is not safe from it attack it begin by separating one of the bird from the rest of the covey and then circling about above it in a spiral which grows smaller and smaller it descends until it can reach it victim with it claw and knock it down with a blow on the breast such are the principal diurnal bird of prey that we have to make war upon without mercy up and after these savage bloodsucker destroyer of game ravagers of poultryyards and pigeoncotes take your gun vigilant farmer watch for the falcon and the goshawk and let fire at those brigand destroy their nest break their egg and wring the neck of their young if you wish to save your chicken duck and pigeon kestrel kite and buzzard the kestrel belongs to the falcon family a may be seen from the small sharp tooth on each side of the tip of the beak it is rather a handsome bird about the size of a pigeon red in color with black spot and a white tip to the tail the beak is blue and the leg are yellow the kestrel is the most widely scattered bird of prey and the one most often seen near human habitation it favorite haunt are old castle lofty tower and belfry one often see it flying with untiring wing around these building uttering the while a piercing cry plee plee plee pree pree pree which it sends forth to frighten the sparrow snuggling in hole in the wall so that it may seize them when they fly out it carefully pluck the little captured bird before eating them but it ha another kind of prey which give it le trouble and that is the mouse which it enters open barn in order to catch also the fat and savory fieldmouse which it spy from on high when holding itself motionless in the air in one position with tail and wing gracefully extended what will it do with it catch will it skin the creature for the sake of cleanliness a it pluck the sparrow no the common mouse and the fieldmouse are dainty morsel of which the kestrel would be loath to lose a single drop of blood the rodent is swallowed just a it is whole if small piecemeal if large after digestion the skin and bone are thrown up through the beak in the form of little ball just a in the case of the owl the kestrel nest in old tower abandoned ruin hollow rock it nest made of twig and root hold four or five rustcolored egg marbled with brown we will pas now to the kite which is different from all other bird of prey with it broad and forked tail it very long wing it rather slender claw and it very small beak a beak not at all in keeping with the bird size which exceeds that of the falcon this beak make the bird cowardly to excess frightened by the slightest danger put to flight by a mere crow if pressed by hunger however the kite will venture into the neighborhood of pigeoncotes and poultryyards in order to seize young pigeon and little chicken fortunately the hen if she ha time to gather her brood under her wing can scare the invader away by simply showing her anger for want of poultry the kite which is hated by thrifty country people attack reptile rat fieldmouse and meadowmice and if it can get nothing else it will content itself with carrion such a dead sheep and spoiled fish the kite extended wing measure more than a meter and a half from tip to tip and it flight present a fine spectacle when the bird sweep in wide circle through the upper atmosphere it is a if it were swimming gliding without the least apparent exertion then all at once it stop in it flight and remains suspended in one position for a quarter of an hour at a stretch held there by an invisible movement of the wing the kite is of a deep red hue on the back and rustcolored on the breast and stomach with a whitish head and the large wingfeathers black it cry resembles a cat mewing it build it nest in tall tree or still oftener in the hollow of rock it egg commonly three in number are white shading into dingy yellow and speckled with a few irregular brown spot the bird known a harrier have a small semicircular collar of fine thick feather projecting from each side of the face and reaching from beak to ear much like the ring around the hornless owl eye in the contour of the breast in the long leg and wing and in the still longer tail they have something of the falcon appearance and bearing while in their large head and in the little collar around the face they are not unlike the nocturnal bird of prey harrier frequent marsh and the bank of stagnant body of water where they lie concealed among the rush in order to seize any small rodent reptile or insect that may come within their reach the farmer ha no complaint to bring against them a they show proper respect for his little pigeon chicken and duckling indeed they are welcome visitor on account of their strong liking for fieldmouse unfortunately the hunter accuses them of killing game especially waterfowl hare and rabbit in this connection it is to be noted that the weasel a small carnivorous quadruped with a thirst for blood is wont to make it way into warren in quest of young hare and rabbit in order to suck their blood after which the dead body are left behind some bush these murderous operation do not escape the harrier vigilance in it leisurely flight it keep a sharp eye on the surroundings of all warren in the wood for the purpose of carrying off any dead body and feasting on the weasel leaving that it may occasionally be at fault and mistake a live rabbit for a dead one i should not dare deny but after all i forgive it willingly enough and in consideration of it war on fieldmouse i should be inclined to bestow upon it the honorable title of farmer helper if we may feel some uncertainty about harrier there is no such doubt concerning buzzard in them we certainly have very valuable helper large eater of fieldmouse and meadowmice and great destroyer of mole those tireless burrowers whose number must be kept within strict limit buzzard have a short wide beak curving downward from the base wing very long but not pointed reaching almost to the tip of the tail strong leg and the space between the eye and nostril bristling with hair buzzard are fond of repose and phlegmatic by nature or it might be more accurate to say that they are endowed with a remarkable capacity for patient and motionless waiting a gift very necessary for the successful hunting of the fieldmouse which must be watched for by the hour at the mouth of it burrow for half a day at a time if need be the buzzard lie in wait without making the least movement or giving the slightest sign of impatience one would take it to be asleep then all of a sudden the bird fall to hacking the soil with it beak and tearing the turf with it powerful claw a disemboweled mole is brought to light or perhaps a fieldmouse is the prize and in either event the victim is no sooner caught than swallowed now do you know what reputation the buzzard ha won by this habit of long and motionless waiting so indispensable in the quest of game with the acuteness of hearing characteristic of the mole and of rodent the reputation of stupidity we say of a person of limited intelligence that he is a stupid a a buzzard here again is an instance of that wrongheadedness which make u think little of so many of our helper and glorify those that prey upon u stupidity is the name we give to the buzzard peculiarity and for no better reason than that the bird spare our poultryyards and rids u of troublesome rodent whereas we speak of the eagle which steal our lamb and of the falcon plunderer of chickencoops a courageous noble and splendid the common buzzard is a large brown bird with a whitish throat stomachfeathers marked with little line alternately brown and white and tail crossed by nine or ten dark stripe it beak is whitish at the base and black at the tip it eye and leg yellow this specie nest in tall tree the nest being made of interwoven twig and lined with wool and hair it lay but three egg at most which are whitish and irregularly sprinkled with dingy yellow spot it is the common buzzard especially that ha won the reputation of stupidity with it leisurely flying and it patience in watching for prey it usually watch on some mound of earth observer who have studied it habit say that sixteen is about the number of mouse it commonly eats in one day which make nearly six thousand a year thats the kind of bird we should like to have about our house if we could only tame it remarked jules there is nothing to prevent our trying it his uncle rejoined the buzzard disposition is good enough other observer who have studied it hunting of fieldmouse estimate that it eats nearly four thousand of these in one year from this number you can form some idea of the multitude of little rodent a whole flock of buzzard would be able to destroy but we must not give the bird too much praise i know that it doe not hesitate when occasion offer to seize and carry off a wounded young hare and i also know that when the snow is on the ground and the buzzard is pressed by hunger it will pounce upon any stray chicken that may have got out of the poultryyard but what are these few act of theft when compared with the thousand of rodent of all kind that it clear away from our field whatever the season of the year one can not open a buzzard crop without finding common mouse fieldmouse and meadowmice there by the dozen if i owned a field that wa ravaged by these rodent i should lose no time in planting a few stump there to serve a perch and watchtower for buzzard in their patient hunt for their favorite game there is another variety of buzzard the hawkbuzzard that doe u good service in it fondness for larvæ caterpillar and insect generally particularly wasp what those wasp that hurt so when they sting asked emile yes my boy this buzzard feast on the wasp whose sting is so painful to u it swallow them without a thought of their sting just a the hedgehog devours the viper and never worry about it venomous fang the bird attack their nest with it beak and pull out the nymph from their cell carrying them fat and tender to it little one this buzzard is a somewhat smaller bird than the common buzzard it back is brown it throat light yellow with brown stripe and it breast and stomach white sprinkled with dark heartshaped spot the tail is crossed by three wide dark band the beak is black and finally the head of the old male is bluishgray the bird nest in wood in tall tree and it egg are rather small being yellowishwhite in color but with so thick a sprinkling of large brown spot a sometimes almost to hide the color underneath the featherlegged buzzard ha leg covered with long feather a in certain specie of pigeon bearing the same qualifying name it frequents river bank uncultivated field and wood and life on fieldmouse mole reptile and if need be on insect here let u bring to a close our talk on bird of prey i have told you about the more important one both diurnal and nocturnal about their habit their food and the service or the harm they do u it is now for you to add to what these brief talk have taught you by observing the thing that come under your eye every day do not fail to examine with some care the buzzard a you see it perched on a mound and patiently watching for a fieldmouse also the kestrel a it fly screaming around the belfry and pounce sometimes on a mouse sometimes on a sparrow and the kite too a it soar on motionless wing in the blue sky you will get from this sort of study first a great deal of pleasure and secondly knowledge that will be highly useful if you ever have a farm or a garden it seems to me said jules that you have left out the very commonest of the bird of prey the crow crow are not bird of prey replied uncle paul they have not the hooked beak the clutching claw or the sharp curved nail of bird formed for a life of rapine i will tell you about them tomorrow or rather i will begin with that one of the crow family known a the raven the raven their black plumage and similarity of shape make u mistake all sort of bird for crow let u begin with one of these the raven this bird is of good size being about a large a our domestic rooster and it ha a hoarse cry uttered slowlycraa craa craa it is the raven that ha won such a reputation with child from that famous fable about the raven and the fox yes i know emile hastened to interpose you mean the one that begin master raven perched on a tree held a piece of cheese in his beak where do you suppose he got that cheese history remains silent on that important question but my opinion would be that he stole it from some windowsill where the farmer wife had put out some newly made cheese to dry in a little wicker basket the fox say good morning to mr raven and praise his plumage continued emile and he go on how trig and trim you are how handsome you look to me and so on and so forth how could the raven help having a swelled head after such flattery that fox wa certainly a cunning rogue to make sure that the bird will listen instead of beginning with flattery that might have aroused his intended victim suspicion for the bird wa not altogether lacking in common sense he began by praising what is really not without merit on a near view the raven is seen to be not by any mean of a dead black it show glint of purple and blue on the back and a flickering greenish tinge on the stomach the total effect being that of some highly polished metal at the first flattering word you may be sure the raven cast a complacent glance at it costume and seeing it brilliant with blue purple and green found it quite a rich a the fox declared it to be so now the bird wa well preparedready for the fulsome flattery that wa to follow the fox would have it believe the offensive odor clinging to it from eating so much carrion to be the aroma of musk and it hoarse croaking to be melodious warbling but just there wa the difficulty to make it croak and thus open it mouth which held the cheese and if that voice of thine can match thy plumage fine thou art the very phenix of all the wood around quoted emile yes thats it said uncle paul do you see how the sly rascal is making headway he would have the raven believe itself a singer mistake it raucous craa craa for the note of the nightingale had he begun with any such extravagant compliment he would have defeated his own end but he very cleverly led up to this supreme flattery and to pique the raven foolish vanity still further gave a doubtful tone to his admiration i know wa what he seemed to the bird to say that your voice is widely celebrated but what i am not so sure of is whether it match your splendid plumage whether you can really sing in a manner worthy of so magnificent a costume i must hear you and if your vocal performance equal your outward appearance then you will indeed prove yourself to be the paragon of bird the very phenix of these forest ah you doubt it said the raven to itself well then listen to this operatic trill craa craa craa emile again took up the fable and so to prove it could it boastfulness make good it opened wide it beak and thus let fall the cheese which master fox did seize not so fast his uncle interrupted him master fox could not have gone on talking with the cheese in his mouth he could not have pointed the moral in that neat little lesson with which the fable end i can see him putting his paw on the prize while he lick his chop and look tauntingly at the shamefaced bird my good sir he say let me call your attention to the fact that you are a conceited nincompoop he doesnt call the bird mr raven any more now that he got hold of the cheese emile observed no to call him that wa all very well in the beginning it flattered the bird but now the fox make fun of his dupe and call him my good sir in a tone of patronizing condolence to express pity for those we have cajoled and deceivedis not that the very perfection of roguery there we have most assuredly a fox that will make his way in the world read in la fontaine the incomparable storyteller the abominable trick master reynard play later on the goat the wolf and many others or better wait a while and we will read them together next winter before the open fire for the present we will leave the raven of the fable and try to learn something about the real raven manner of living raven do not flock together a crow do but live alone or in pair on rocky height and in the tallest tree the society or even the near neighborhood of it fellow is unbearable to a raven with angry peckings it drive away from it chosen district any of it kind that may try to establish themselves there even though they may have been born in the same nest if the intruder is merely a bird of passage it is conducted with menacing demonstration to the frontier of the domain and is jealously watched until it disappears in the distance crow social creature are treated in the same way the raven asks to be left alone quite alone on it bare rock and woe to the illadvised intruder that disturbs it solitude it build it nest in the topmost branch of a solitary tree or still more to it liking in some fissure that offer itself in the perpendicular face of a rocky precipice the nest is made of stick and root on the outside and of moss hair rag and fine grass within i should like to know said jules what raven egg are like bird egg are usually remarkable for their beauty both in shape and in color and for this reason if for no other they merit our attention but it is no idle or merely ornamental accomplishment to be able to distinguish one from another to know whether any given egg belongs to a useful specie that should be respected or to a harmful specie that should not be allowed to breed in the vicinity of our field and garden with this end in view i have already told you the characteristic mark of the egg of our principal bird of prey some of which egg should be destroyed without any consideration while others should be protected a this is a matter that interest you i will continue in the same way and will describe the egg of those bird that we are still to talk about know then that raven egg are much more beautifully colored than might be expected from the somber plumage of the bird they are bluish green with brown spot this background of bluish green sometimes lighter and sometimes darker occurs again together with the brown spot in the egg of crow magpie jay blackbird thrush and fieldfare bird that resemble one another closely in their bodily structure despite their marked difference in size plumage and habit the egg of certain blackbird and fieldfare are of a magnificent skyblue color the raven is an omnivorous creature fruit larvæ insect sprouting grain flesh whether in a fresh condition or otherwise all suit it equally well but it favorite fare is carrion which it know how to find a long way off guided by sight and smell wherever there is a dead animal there the raven make it appearance and contends for the loathsome quarry with dog the habit of gorging itself with this infected food give it a repulsive odor for lack of dead preythe sort most acceptable to it taste it great appetite and it cowardicethe raven hunt such live prey a young hare and young rabbit and other small and destructive rodent it pilfers from bird nest both egg and newborn bird a succulent banquet for it young and it even ha the boldness to carry off little chicken from poultryyards without offering the slightest plea in it favor i leave the raven to the hatred it ha always incurred by reason of it funereal plumage it forbidding aspect it sinister croaking repulsive odor filthy greed and savage disposition the crow in france we have four kind of crow the black crow the mantled daw the rook or harvest crow and the jackdaw or little belfry crow the black crow ha the same plumage and the same general appearance a the raven but is onequarter smaller during the summer these bird live in pair in the wood which they leave only to get something to eat in the spring their food consists of bird egg especially the egg of partridge which they know how to puncture skilfully so a to carry them to their young on the point of the beak like the raven this bird is fond of decayed flesh and little bird still covered with down crow attack small weak or wounded game and venture into poultryyards to carry off any unwary duckling or little chicken that may have strayed away from their mother spoiled fish worm insect fruit seed according to season and locality fill their crop they especially like nut which they know how to break by letting them fall from a sufficient height in winter black crow gather in large flock either in an unmixed company or together with rook and mantled daw they go wandering about in the field mingling with the flock and sometimes even alighting on a sheep back to hunt for vermin under the wool they follow the plowman to feed on the larvæ turned up by his plowshare and they explore the seeded ground and eat recently sown grain made tender and sweet by germination toward evening they fly together to the tall tree of some neighboring wood where they chatter noisily a the sun set and smooth their feather and finally go to sleep these tree are meetingplaces where every evening the crow gather from different quarter sometimes from several mile around at daybreak they divide into flock of greater or le size and disperse in all direction to hunt for food in the tilled field at the end of winter this company is broken up the crow pair off and each pair chooses in the neighboring forest a district a quarter of a league in extent from which every other couple is excluded this arrangement ensuring sufficient subsistence for each establishment in the bird colony the nest is built in some tree of medium size and is made of small twig and root interwoven and rudely cemented with loam or horse dung a mattress of fine rootlet being laid inside if some bird of prey happens to come too near this nest it owner assail the intruder with fury and crack it skull with a blow of the beak good for you brave crow cried emile your enemy will think twice before they come and bother you i admire the courage of crow in protecting their young uncle paul admitted but i can not forgive them their plundering of poultryyards their theft of young bird and egg and their upturning of seeded ground we must then include the black crow among bandit that are to be destroyed in the same class too we must place the mantled daw so called from the sort of grayishwhite cloak that reach from the shoulder to the tail both in front and on the back the rest of the plumage is black with glint of blue like the raven this bird come to u toward the end of autumn join the company of black crow and rook and may be seen searching our field for larvæ and sprouting grain on the seashore where it number are much greater than in the interior it life on fish and mollusk cast up by the wave or left by fisherman only under dire necessity will it touch carrion the favorite food of the black crow and the raven in march the mantled daw leaf u to go and breed in the north the rook which is a little smaller than the black crow ha the latter plumage but with more of a violet and coppery luster it beak too is more nearly straight and ha a sharper tip it is readily distinguished from the crow and the raven by the characteristic mark of it occupation the skin of it forehead and around the beak being bare of feather and looking white and powdery like a scar is the bird born like that not at all just a a workman handling rough and heavy object make his hand callous so the rook acquires by it work the rough and scaly skin so noticeable on it forehead it is a tireless digger and it beak is it pick which it thrust into the ground a deeply a it can from constant friction with the soil the forehead and the base of the beak lose their feather and become bald or even have the skin itself worn away so a to leave a rough scar the rook object in this toilsome operation is to capture white worm and all the destructive larvæ that are such a scourge to our cultivated field i saw some rook one day hard at work in a waste tract of land lifting up and turning over the stone scattered here and there so eager were they that they sometimes threw the smaller stone a high a a man head now guess what they were looking for so busily they were looking for insect and all sort of vermin in this work of turning over stone and digging in the soil rook can not fail to injure their tool the beak and they must rub the feather off from it base i should have a high opinion of these bird if they contented themselves with hunting insect but unfortunately they have a decided fondness for sprouting seed a dainty dish that they exert all their ingenuity to procure it is said that they bury acorn and leave them in the ground until they begin to sprout and have lost their bitter taste when they dig them up and eat them what a bright idea emile exclaimed the hard bitter acorn is buried in the ground to get mellow and when the rook think it ha stayed there just long enough he ha so good a memory he can go and find it again and dig it up by that time it is just right to eat soft and sweet and a fine feast for mr rook so far there is nothing to find fault with said uncle paul a bushel more or le of acorn is a small matter and i willingly hand them over to the rook to dispose of in their curious fashion but other sprouting seed suit them equally well especially wheat which they can so easily procure in winter in the recently sown field when i see a flock of rook sedately pacing the furrow and plunging their beak in here and there where the ground is softened by a thaw i know well enough those bird might pretend they were hunting for junebug larvæ but he would be a simpleton indeed who accepted this explanation at that time of year when the worm are all too deep in the ground for the rook beak to reach them it is wheat they are really after and a rook go in very large flock which may even darken the sky in their flight you can easily understand that such reaper make short work of their harvest nor is that all in the autumn rook consume great quantity of walnut and chestnut and in the spring they dig up potato field to obtain the newly planted tuber couldnt they live on dead animal a the black crow and the raven do asked louis no a rook however hungry will not touch a dead animal it must have seed and fruit or larvæ and insect and a it chooses one or the other of these kind of food the rook is our foe or our friend so there are two opinion about the bird some person remembering only it theft would wage a relentless war against it feeling that each rook destroyed mean a bushel of wheat gained others mindful chiefly of it destruction of larvæ and insect maintain that the rook deserves kind treatment at the farmer hand because it rids his field of vermin following the plowman to pick up white worm in the furrow and plunging it sharp beak into the ground for the grub of the junebug for these excellent reason they declare the rook worthy of our protection then which of the two opinion are we to accept wa louis query to my thinking neither of them but something halfway between a in the case of the mole if white worm abound let u bear with the rook a it make war on these enemy of ours but if we have no need of it help let u chase the bird from our field in our warfare on destructive insect we have two real helper the mole and the rook but unfortunately we have to weigh their ravage against their service accordingly let u treat them with forbearance if we have a worse ill to dread but rid ourselves of their presence if our field are in good condition all the year round the rook life with it own kind it go in flock to seek food and in flock it chooses it breedingplace sometimes a single oak ha a dozen nest with a many in each of the tree around over a large tract of ground there is great commotion in this aërial city at the time of nestbuilding for rook are very clamorous and also much given to stealing from their neighbor when a young and inexperienced couple suspend building operation for a moment to go and get further material for construction the neighbor pillage the halfcompleted nest this one carry off a little stick that one a blade of grass and some moss to use in their own work on their return the robbed one are thrown into a terrible passion accuse this one and that one take counsel with friend and attack the robber furiously if the theft ha not been cleverly concealed experienced couple never leave the nest unguarded but one stay and watch while the other go for building material the jackdaw or little belfrycrow is all black and about the size of a pigeon like rook these bird fly in flock and nest with their own kind high tower old castle and the belfry of gothic church are their favorite abode their nest which are made of a few stick and a little straw sometimes are placed each by itself in a hole in the wall and sometimes are very near together in huddled group the jackdaw when flying keep uttering a harsh and piercing cry it feed on insect worm larvæ and fruit but never on decayed flesh it render u some service by clearing tree of caterpillar but i complain of it for hunting the egg of little bird although jackdaw are always to be found about our old building they nevertheless move from place to place usually in large flock sometimes of their own kind exclusively at other time in company with rook and mantled daw woodpecker in front of uncle paul house there is a grove of beech several century old it branch interlacing at a great height and forming a continuous canopy supported by hundred of tree trunk a smooth and white a stone column in the autumn that is where emile and jules go and hunt in the moss for mushroom of all color to show to their uncle who tell the boy how to distinguish the edible from the poisonous kind there too they hunt for beetle the stagbeetle whose large fat head bear enormous branching nipper great black capricornbeetles that may be seen at sunset running along the dead branch and clinging to them a they go with their jointed antennæ which are longer than the insect body and longhorn beetle likewise furnished with antennæ of unusual length and also remarkable for their wing sheath richly colored with blue or yellow or red with spot and stripe of black velvet a multitude of bird of many kind make this grove their abode there the quarrelsome jay fight with one of it own specie for the possession of a beechnut there the magpie chatter on a high branch and then fly down and alights in a neighboring field jerking up it tail and looking around with an air of defiance crow have their evening rendezvous there and there the woodpecker hammer away at old bark to make the insect come out so that it may snap them up with it viscous tongue listen to the bird at it work toc toc toc if it is interrupted in it task it fly away with a cry of teo teo teo repeated thirty or forty time in quick succession and resembling a noisy burst of laughter what bird is it that seems to be making fun of u with such loud laughter a it fly off emile and jules asked each other one day when they were watching from their window the woodpecker and the jay at play in the branch of the old beechtrees jacques their uncle gardener heard them a he wa watering the cabbage bed after finishing a series of little trench to carry the water to all part of the bed he came up to the window for a talk with the boy that bird you see there said he with green plumage and a red head is a woodpecker it ha several different cry if it is going to rain it say plieu plieu in a longdrawn and plaintive tone when at work in order to keep up it spirit it every now and then give a harsh cry tiackackan tiackackan so that the whole forest echo with it in the nesting season it give a quick teo teo teo just like what you heard a moment ago then it ha it nest now in the beech grove asked jules it is at work on it for all the morning ive heard it hammering away with all it might you see it make it nest in a hole that it hollow out by pecking the trunk of a tree with it beak it a fine beak it ha too so hard and pointed that the bird is always afraid of going too deep into the wood so after two or three good hard peck it skip round to the other side of the trunk to see if it hasnt bored clear through bah youre only in fun returned jules not at all protested jacques it what ive heard said and ive often seen the woodpecker hurry round to look at the other side of the trunk but the bird must have some other reason than just to see whether or not the tree is bored through im going to ask uncle ask him too if he know the ironweed that the woodpecker rub it beak on to make it harder than steel your ironweed sound to me like a fairy tale well im only telling you what ive heard i dont know anything about it myself but they say it a very rare weed and that the woodpecker go to look for it in the mountain so that it may harden and whet it beak on it and anything you touch to that weed becomes a hard a the best steel what a find that would be for my scythe and my hedgingbill my sickle and graftingknife i know many a man that would give a bag of gold for the woodpecker secret the young cabbage plant had by this time received enough water and it wa now the lettuce turn jacques went back to his work and left the boy to puzzle over the question whether or not there wa any truth in this story of the woodpecker fear lest it might bore through the tree trunk with each peck of it beak they brought the matter up that evening in their talk with their uncle there is both truth and falsehood in what my good jacques told you he said the true is what he saw with his own eye the false what he repeat from hearsay among the country folk he told you correctly about the woodpecker different cry which he know so well from having heard them over and over again and he wa right about the bird way of running around to the other side of the trunk that it ha just struck several time with it beak all the rest is false or rather an amusing legend with a basis of fact which we will now examine woodpecker live solely on insect and larvæ especially those specie of insect and larvæ that are found in wood the large grub of capricornbeetles stagbeetles longhorn beetle and others are their favorite dish to get at them they have to clear away the dead bark and bore into the wormeaten wood beneath the instrument used in this rough work is the bird beak which is straight and wedgeshaped square at the base fluted lengthwise and shaped at the point like a carpenter chisel it is so hard and durable that in order to account for a tool of such perfection some simpleminded woodcutter made up the story that ha been repeated ever since the childish story of the ironweed need i tell you that there is nothing in the world that by it mere touch can give to object the hardness of iron or steel i had my doubt jules declared when jacques wa telling u about it i couldnt believe in his wonderful weed the woodpecker ha no need to rub it beak against anything to give it the hardness necessary for the work to be done it is born with a good strong beak to begin with and keep it to the end and that beak never ha to be retempered it is the continuation of a very thick skull which can withstand rather violent shock and it is operated by a short strong neck which can keep up it hammering without fatigue even should the bird wish to bore into the very heart of a tree trunk after it ha drilled it hole the woodpecker dart into it an exceedingly long tongue wormshaped and viscousthat is coated with a sort of mucilage made by the salivaand armed with a hard barbed point with which it transfixes the larvæ that have been uncovered to climb the trunk of the tree to be operated upon and for hour at a time if need be to stay there where larvæ seem to be lurking the woodpecker ha short muscular leg which end in stout claw each foot having four talon or toe two pointing forward and two backward armed with curved nail of great strength the bird way of standing on the vertical surface of a tree trunk is made possible not only by the division of it talon a i have described them with their strong nail clinging to rough bark but also by a third support furnished by the tail the large tail feather are stiff slightly bent downward worn at the tip and supplied with rough barb when the woodpecker start in on what promise to be a long job it plant itself firmly on the tripod of it tail and two foot and hold itself steady even in position that would seem to be highly uncomfortable without fatigue and without pause it can strip an entire tree trunk of it driedup bark the object of it persevering search are the insect hidden under this bark it can tell by the sound made when it strike the tree with it beak whether or not the wood is decayed and full of insect a hollow sound being of good omen to the bird if the wood doe not give out this hollow sound the woodpecker know that further drilling at that point would be but so much labor wasted in the first case it strip off the bark make the wood beneath fly this way and that in a shower of little chip clear off the wormhole dust and finally reach the plump grub in it snug retreat in the second case it strike two or three welldirected blow to start the dry bark and frighten any insect that may be lurking underneath immediately this insect population run in alarm some to the right others to the left toward the opposite side of the tree trunk but the woodpecker knowing well enough what is going on reach the other side in time to nab the fugitive now said jules i understand what jacques wa saying the woodpecker doesnt run around the tree to see whether or not it ha bored through to the other side but to gobble up the insect that are trying to get away i thought the woodpecker must be very silly to think it could drill right through the trunk of a tree with one peck of it beak but now that i know the real reason of what it doe i see that it a wonderfully clever bird i assure you once more that animal have more intelligence than they are given credit for let u beware of seeing an evil meaning in habit and aptitude that we do not understand is it not said of the buzzard that it is a stupid bird just because it show such patience in watching and waiting perfectly motionless for the fieldmouse it suspect to be lurking under the ground and here we have the woodpecker accused of being so foolish a to think it can pierce a tree trunk with one blow of it beak merely because it run around to capture the insect fleeing to the other side bear this in mind there is in animal no foolishness except what we ascribe to them from our own point of view whenever we are able to discover the real motive we always find their action perfectly logical and that is only what might have been expected for an animal ha no choice in it act but is made to perform them according to it mode of life a determined from the beginning by divine wisdom man alone is free by a sublime privilege he is left to choose between good and evil between sound reason and blind passion he seek and chooses at his own risk and peril the true or the false the just or the unjust the beautiful or the ugly but animal having no spiritual battle to fight a we have are now what they have always been and always will be they do today what they did yesterday and will do tomorrow for century and century they go on doing the same thing without improvement or deterioration and with an unfailing sense given them by god woodpecker spend their life running around tree trunk from top to bottom in order to start the old bark that shelter insect and exploring all fissure with their long pointed tongue which is pushed down into every hole where worm may possibly be hiding these bird are placed in our forest a keeper they inspect sickly tree in particular tree honeycombed by vermin and they examine carefully the diseased part occasionally they may chance to attack a healthy part especially in making their nest and they may thus injure the tree by drilling into the live wood but this damage is more than atoned for in the long run and so i do not hesitate to bestow upon our woodpecker the title of forestpreservers a title earned by their assiduous warfare on insect injurious to wood seldom do they leave their timberyardthe trunk and the main branch of the treeand descend to the ground except when they chance to find an anthill the inmate of which they devour with delight they place their nest at a considerable height from the ground deep down in a round hole bored with the beak in the heart of some tree trunk the bedding consists of moss and wool and the egg four to six in number are in every instance white smooth and a lustrous a ivory more about woodpecker the commonest of our woodpecker is the green woodpecker which is about a large a a turtledove it plumage ha a richness rarely seen in that of any of our other bird the top of the head and the nape of the neck are of a magnificent crimson two mustache of the same hue adorn the bird face the back is green the breast and stomach yellowish white the rump yellow and the large wingfeathers black with regular mark of white on the edge the female ha le brilliant coloring than the male and it mustache are black instead of red it is the green woodpecker that you heard in the grove this morning giving it cry of teo teo teo i will not go over what jacques ha already told you about it different cry the green woodpecker is passionately fond of ant and when it discovers an anthill it post itself near by and stretch it long viscous tongue across the path the ant follow you know these little creature way of marching in long file one or more following the exact path taken by the leader the woodpecker viscous tongue is extended across this line of march the ant from behind come up hesitate a moment before the barricade and then venture upon the tongue in order to follow their friend marching on ahead a if nothing had happened immediately we have one ant caught then four then ten all struggling in the sticky mucilage covering the tongue the woodpecker doe not move but remains quiet until it tongue is quite covered nor ha it long to wait soon the living trap laden with game is withdrawn into the beak ah that wa a luscious mouthful without leaving the spot the anteater repeat this performance again and again laying it tongue on the ground and then drawing it in black with ant until it hunger is satisfied animal know more than one would think a you said a while ago emile remarked that trick of the woodpecker show it plainly enough instead of picking the ant up one by one which would be very slow work with such small game the woodpecker take them dozen at a time it lay it tongue across their path on the ground draw it in again when it is all plastered over with ant and the thing is done and the mouthful is well worth the trouble who would have thought of making a trap of one tongue a trap that catch game with glue but it passion for ant resumed uncle paul doe not make the woodpecker neglect it duty a keeper of forest it go climbing up tree trunk tapping the sickly part and pecking away with blow that at a distance sound like hammer stroke if a passerby interrupt it at it work it doe not immediately fly away but run around the trunk like a squirrel and from the other side stick out it head a little to see who or what is coming if the intruder advance the woodpecker go on around the tree always keeping on the opposite side until it becomes frightened when it fly off making the wood ring with it sonorous tiackackan tiackackan it fly with swift dart and bound swooping down then rising describing a series of undulating arch in the air for it nest it bore out a deep hole in softwood tree such a fir and poplar male and female work with lusty blow of the beak taking turn at the hardest part of the task the piercing of the live wood of the trunk until the wormeaten center is reached chip wooddust and decayed fragment are dug out with the foot and at last the hole is deep enough and slanting enough to exclude the light of day the young one leave the nest before they can fly and they may be seen exercising near it learning to climb to run around the trunk of their tree and to cling to it upside down you will be amused to watch them if you ever have the good fortune to be present at the frolic of a young family of woodpecker the great spotted woodpecker is about a large a a thrush it ha a wide red stripe across the nape of the neck the upper part of the body is prettily spotted with pure white and deep black and the under part is white a far a the abdomen which is red a is also the rump the female ha no red on the nape of the neck the food of this bird is the same a the green woodpecker it strike the tree with quicker smarter blow and if disturbed in it work it remains motionless in the shelter of a large branch with it green eye fixed on the object of it distrust it cry is a kind of hoarse grinding trerrerrerrer the variegated woodpecker much resembles the great spotted woodpecker in plumage but is a little smaller it is adorned with a red cap which cover the whole of the upper part and the back of the head while the great spotted woodpecker ha only a stripe of this color on the nape of the neck both these bird are found in the large wooded district of france and they live on the same dietinsects woodboring larvæ and ant also because of their velvet costume of black and white and their scarlet cap they are both to be ranked among the prettiest bird we have let u add to them the little spotted woodpecker it is smaller than a sparrow and it dress is that of the great spotted woodpecker this bird is found almost exclusively in the fir forest of the east and of the pyrenees the wryneck is closely akin to the woodpecker in the structure of it foot whose four toe or talon are divided into two pair one pointing forward and the other backward and in it very long and viscous tongue which it push into anthill or stretch out on the ground to receive the insect a they pas it is a small bird being no larger than a lark it plumage is watered with black brown gray and russet somewhat like the woodcock but with tint better defined and more beautiful in their combined effect the wryneck is a great eater of caterpillar and it is also passionately fond of ant which it catch a doe the woodpecker with it sticky tongue laid on the ground across their path it name come from the habit it ha of twisting it neck and looking backward with a sort of slow and undulating movement like a snake why doe it imitate a snake like that emile inquired it is it way of expressing surprise and alarm and perhaps it also hope to frighten it foe with the motion at any rate it is sometimes successful if a birdnesthunter climb up to it hole to steal it little one the wryneck emits from the depth of it retreat a sharp hissing and begin to make snakelike movement with it neck the young bird still featherless imitate their mother to the best of their ability and succeed so well that the hunter think he ha thrust his hand into a nest of writhing and twisting flatheaded viper thoroughly frightened the boy clamber down not without leaving some shred of his breech on the way serf the rascal right too declared emile the wryneck reach u in april and leaf toward the end of summer it haunt the outskirt of wood and visit garden and orchard for caterpillar it nest in a hole in a tree trunk and gladly avail itself of the woodpecker abandoned quarter after furbishing them up a little to suit itself the egg which are white and polished like the woodpecker rest on a simple little bed of wooddust that the bird dislodges from the wall of it hole with a few blow of it beak despite the structure of it foot the wryneck doe not climb tree trunk and rarely even perch on them preferring to stay on the ground and hunt caterpillar or stretch out it tongue in the ant path which ha given it in the south the name of stretchtongue the nuthatch on the contrary though differing from the woodpecker in the formation of it claw is a firstrate climber and spends it life running about on the trunk of tree inspecting every crack and cranny for insect and pecking at the old bark three of it talon point forward the fourth alone being turned in the opposite direction but for firmness of support the last is worth two of the others so thick and powerful is it and the nail at the end so strong and hooked the beak resembles the woodpecker being straight fluted lengthwise and sharply pointed it is an excellent tool for digging into wood and getting out the worm the tongue can not be projected like the woodpecker to catch insect with it glue nor doe the tail serve a a support the nuthatch examines old tree with painstaking care going up and down the trunk repeatedly or around it in a spiral and sometimes visiting a branch above or below or on one side every crack is explored with the point of the beak to the accompaniment of the bird resonant cry tuee tuee tuee repeated again and again in a penetrating tone very few insect can escape so careful a search if grub are lacking the nuthatch make a frugal meal of a hazelnut first it fix the nut firmly in the fork made by two branch and then it hammer away at it encouraging itself the while by uttering it cry until the hard shell is pierced and the kernel exposed it must take the bird a long time to crack a hazelnut with it beak wa the opinion of jules no it is done very quickly the beak is so hard and pointed very quickly too a caged nuthatch will break through the woodwork of it prison and make an opening large enough to escape through not even the woodpecker ha a better carpenter chisel the nuthatch is about a large a a sparrow all the upper part of it plumage is of a bluish ash color the throat and cheek are white and the breast and stomach red a black stripe starting from the corner of the beak pass over the eye and down the side of the neck this bird nest in a hole in a tree trunk and it know how if need be to make the opening of the nest smaller with a little moistened clay it egg from five to seven in number are laid on moss or wooddust and are of a dingy white dotted with red it get it name of nuthatch which mean nuthacker from it way of hacking the nut it is so fond of climbersthe hoopoe i have been telling you about woodpecker and the nuthatch insecteaters with chiselshaped beak for cutting into tree and getting out the worm hidden in the wood then i spoke of the wryneck which doe not use it beak for hacking old tree trunk but can like the woodpecker stick out it tongue on the ant path and catch the insect with the glue of it saliva now we come to some more insecteaters but their work is le laborious than that of the woodpecker they do not hack and hew tree trunk but merely seek their prey in the crack and cranny that serve a it refuge for this kind of hunting they have a long and slender beak that curve slightly downward a their name implies climber show great agility in climbing their beak is very narrow the better to penetrate the crack in the bark of tree and it is bent like an arch and ha a fine point their foot have three talon pointing forward and one much stronger pointing backward we have in france two climber one of which is furnished with a tail composed of a few long stiff feather that serve a a support to the bird in climbing a the woodpecker tail serf that bird while the other is not thus equipped the socalled common climber is a tiny bird with whitish plumage spotted with brown above and tinged with red on the rump and tail it life is a most laborious one it frequents wood orchard and the tree of our public promenade where you may see it always busily engaged in examining every square inch of the surface of tree trunk in order to thrust it slender beak into the crack of the bark and catch any lurking gnat bug caterpillar or cocoon it run down the trunk a fast a it run up which woodpecker can not do their progress always being upward either in a straight line or spirally it ascends in little leap and bound and help itself along by propping it tail against the tree arrived at the top of the trunk it descends quickly and begin the same operation on the next tree at every step it cheer itself up with it sharp flutelike cry at nightfall it retires into some hole in a tree trunk there too it make it nest which is formed of fine grass and bit of moss held together by thread from spider web it egg from five to seven in number are pure white with red spot the wallclimber or scaler make it way up the perpendicular face of rock rampart and old wall prying out all the various insect and their egg that may be lurking in the fissure with it large claw it cling to these vertical surface and doe not use it tail a a support this bird which is of about the size of a lark ha unusually beautiful plumage of a light ash color with touch of bright red black and pure white on the wing the throat is black and so is the tail the latter being edged with white at the tip the richness of it coloring and the habit it ha of remaining stationary in it flight before the rock or other surface it is exploring just a butterfly hold themselves motionless on their wing while they suck the honey of flower with their trumpet have given it the expressive name of butterfly of the rock it inhabits the alp the pyrenees and the jura mountain in winter it visit old building in our town the hoopoe is especially remarkable for it double row of long red feather edged with black and white which at the bird pleasure are made to lie down toward the back or stand upright on the head and spread out a a handsome crest the rest of the plumage is winecolored except the tail and wing which are black the wing are also ornamented with white stripe running across them in size this bird is about a large a a turtledove it life alone and prefers to remain on the ground usually rarely perching unless on the lower branch of tree it favorite haunt are moist field which it walk over at a sedate pace every now and then erecting it beautiful crest either from satisfaction at having found a savory mouthful or because of being startled by something for it is a very timid bird with it long beak it dig in the ground for grub beetle and cricket or it gather ant on it viscous tongue when it ha had enough it withdraws to some low branch and there digest it food at leisure at the mating season it say poo poo whence without doubt come it familiar nickname of poopoo elegant though it is in appearance the hoopoe is not at all particular about the condition of it nest which it make in the interior of a wormeaten tree trunk it line the hole with a mortar composed of clay and cow dung whereon it place a little bed of dry leaf and moss this nest so deep and so hard to keep clean ought to be cleared out daily but the parent bird doe nothing about it leaving the filth to accumulate until it form a rampart all around the nest this barricade may serve a an excellent defense against the birdnesthunter who would naturally hesitate to thrust his hand into the foul mess and so i will not censure the bird too severely for it poor housekeeping the hoopoe is with u only in summer toward the first of september it cross the mediterranean to pas the winter under the warmer sky of africa the cuckoo in an old peartree with dense foliage at the foot of the garden a blackheaded warbler had built it nest day by day jules had watched the bird a it brought blade of dry grass one by one and wove them into the shape of a cup after which it furnished the interior with a hair mattress then came the egg to the number of five light chestnut in color marbled with darker streak parting the branch very gently in the mother absence and standing on tiptoe jules had peeped into the nest but of course without touching anything he had merely cast a rapid glance at the pretty cluster of five egg lying together at the bottom the laying wa over his uncle told him now would begin the incubation and in a few day five little creature blind and featherless would at the slightest rustling of the foliage stretch their yellow beak wide open in mute appeal for food already jules wa looking forward to the good time he would have in watching from a distance the bringing up of the brood and wa planning how when the little bird should have grown a trifle larger he would put some small caterpillar and worm on the end of a stick and drop them into the nest for the young one to eat then before long the newfledged warbler would leave the nest and the garden would have five more caterpillardestroyers repaying with their service and joyful song the kindhearted attention of their boy friend that wa what jules wa eagerly looking forward to yesterday but today he return from his visit to the nest with a troubled look on his face a strange thing ha happened with the warbler five egg there is a sixth one a little larger and of a different color whence come this strange egg who put it in the nest and why uncle paul on being consulted went to the nest and came back with the egg your warbler nest my dear child he said ha had a fortunate escape but for your visit this morning the young bird would have been lost almost a soon a they were hatched this egg that i have brought back is a cuckoo egg but i dont see how it came to be in the warbler nest or what danger it threatened to the young bird that are coming you will see when i tell you the cuckoo habit it is a curious story the cuckoo is the bird that in early spring when the meadow are sprinkled with violet and the tree are just putting forth their leaf keep repeating it cry of cuckoo cuckoo in a clear and plaintive tone i have often heard it said jules singing on the edge of wood but have never been able to get a good look at it i have seen it flying away emile put in and it seemed to me pretty large the cuckoo is at least a large a a turtledove their uncle continued it plumage is ashy gray on the back and white underneath with numerous brown crosswise stripe resembling those seen on many bird of prey the wing are long a is also the tail which is spotted and tipped with white despite it likeness to the goshawk and sparrowhawk the cuckoo is not to be classed a a bird of prey it talon lack the necessary strength and it beak which is rather long is flattened and only slightly curved those are neither the hooked claw nor the savage beak of a bird living the life of a murderer the cuckoo food consists entirely of insect and caterpillar you remember the processionaries of the oak tree those frightful black caterpillar that spin large silken nest against the trunk of a tree and bristle with barbed hair that cause such terrible itching if you touch them yes answered jules and you told u that the cuckoo eats those caterpillar it feast on them a it doe on all hairy caterpillar but the hair are rolled up into a ball in the stomach and thrown up through the beak a a greedy devourer of insect and caterpillar the cuckoo deserves protection the only regret is that a multitude of little bird most useful to u should be destroyed by it let u consider the fact of the case the female cuckoo never build a nest nor doe she know how to hatch out her own young but let u plead the best excuse we can for her her breast seems to be so formed a not to impart enough warmth to egg to make them hatch and more than that she lay so often throughout the summer a to leave her no time for making a home of her own in short this bird never know the joy of taking care of her young it is not because she will not hatch her own egg but because she can not she ha to leave this work to other bird then the cuckoo egg i found in the garden nest wa left there for the warbler to take care of jules inquired precisely now see by what wonderful planning the strange egg come to be adopted by another mother bear in mind that the cuckoo life exclusively on insect the young cuckoo must have caterpillar where will food of this sort be found if not in the nest of bird that feed on insect a for instance warbler redbreast tomtit nightingale stonechat wagtail and others it is to just these nest that the cuckoo go sometimes it may chance to lay it egg in the nest of bird that live on seed such a linnet bullfinch greenfinches or yellowhammer but even then the choice is wise for if the fosterparents are eater of seed they bring up their young on worm which are easier to digest and so the little cuckoo find in these nest food suited to it need but the cuckoo egg are never laid in the nest of quail partridge or other specie whose young are granivorous from the beginning in a brood whose habitual diet wa not theirs the changeling would surely die of hunger but how asked jules doe the cuckoo know what nest to choose and what one not to choose when it lay it egg if it knew why it laid it egg where it doe i should have to admit that the cuckoo sagacity surpassed man but it doe not know at all the reason for it choice a wise providence ha arranged everything for the bird the eggwhich judged by the cuckoo size should be a large a a pigeon or a turtledovesis hardly a big a a sparrow so that it can easily find a place in the warbler or even the wren tiny nest without arousing the adoptive mother suspicion moreover this egg is variable in it color a if the better to harmonize with the coloring of those with which it will be incubated whether in this or that or the other nest sometimes the cuckoo egg is ashcolored at other time red green or pale blue it may closely resemble the sparrow egg or it may be mottled with spot of smaller or larger size in lesser or greater number or again it may be marbled with black streak but despite these variation it is always easy to see the difference between the cuckoo egg and the others in a nest if one of the egg is found to differ from the others in shape and color that one certainly came from the cuckoo by that sign alone i recognized the egg we have here from the warbler nest the other five jules declared are a like one another a so many drop of water but the sixth which you have there is very different and that is why i am sure it belongs to the cuckoo replied his uncle the cuckoo seems to me said louis very large to be able to get into such a small nest a the warbler the redbreast or the nightingale so a to lay it egg there that is not what the bird doe the egg is laid on the ground anywhere then the mother take it up in her beak put it in a sort of pocket at the base of her gulleta pocket provided for that purposeand fly through the neighboring thicket on the lookout for a place for it final reception when she find a nest to suit her she stretch her neck over the edge open her beak and let the egg gently drop among the others that done the cuckoo fly away and never return to learn the result other egg are placed in the same way here and there one by one in different nest and do the owner of the nest make no objection asked jules if they are at home they receive the cuckoo with angry peck and chase her away but she usually succeeds in choosing the right moment and approach the nest by stealth when the owner are absent but when they come back they must see at least that there is a strange egg in the nest and throw it out not at all whether or not the mother bird perceives that there is an egg too many i could not say but at any rate a there must be cuckoo in the world thing are so arranged that their specie shall not become extinct and all the egg in the nest are watched over and hatched with impartial care until the last young bird is out at first all go well enough the young one need but little food and for one more the parent can easily find enough worm all are fed alike with no more for the child of the house than for the stranger but pretty soon the young cuckoo is found to be growing faster than the others it will soon need for itself alone all the food that it fosterparents can possibly secure with the utmost industry it is always opening it wide beak always complaining of hunger moreover it is cramped for room in the little house of hair and wool it featherless body squatting there flat and red it large head it bottomless abyss of a beak it big bulging eye all give it the appearance of a toad sitting at the bottom of the nest there is no longer room in the house for all it inmate nor yet enough food to live on then a dreadful deed is done the young cuckoo slip under one of the little bird take it on it back which is hollowed a if for the purpose and hold it there by slightly raising it wing dragging itself backward to the raised rim of the nest it rest a moment and then throw the burden over the horrid creature throw out of the nest the little one of the bird that feed it exclaimed emile incredulously yes in cold blood so a to have more room for itself with the tip of it wing it feel around for a moment to make sure the little bird is gone and then return to the bottom of the nest to go through the same process with another and so they all go one after another to the very last all are thrown out of the nest id like to be there to catch him at itthe scoundrel wa emile comment what becomes of the poor little thing pushed out of their own home by the ungrateful young cuckoo if the nest is high above the ground all perish crushed by their fall and the ant immediately begin to suck their blood if it is low some live and take refuge in the moss where the mother come to console them and bring them something to eat the cuckoo remains in sole possession of the nest and the horrid toad will starve to death there said jules the father and mother now that their brood is destroyed wont bring it anything more to eat that is where you are mistaken they continue to feed it liberally a if nothing had happened they perform wonder to satisfy it big appetite they do not allow themselves a minute rest in their effort to fill that beak that is always open and is wide enough to swallow the nurse themselves then the warbler isnt afraid of her greedy nursling that might gobble her up any moment queried jules although she is it mother only by chance she is devoted to it she come joyfully with a caterpillar at the end of her beak while the cuckoo gape at the edge of the nest a ugly a a little monster with no tremor of fear the warbler delivers the mouthful by putting her head into the yawning gulf the gulf close swallow and yawn again demanding something more and all haste is made to satisfy it need kind warbler murmured jules what selfdenial in order to bring up the ugly rascal that ha ravaged her nest so it ha to be uncle paul rejoined or we should long ago have been left with no cuckoo in the world to help u get rid of the processionary caterpillar of the oaktree all the same i dont like that bird and with this jules took up the cuckoo egg he had found in the garden nest may i said he to his uncle with a gesture yes i have no objection answered uncle paul who preferred five warbler in his garden to one vagabond cuckoo and smack went the egg a the boy dashed it to the ground shrike all sort of absurd story have been made up about the cuckoo and it curious habit and thus fable ha added to the actual fact which are in themselves strange enough even today there are in circulation any number of fairy tale on the subject of this bird i will tell you a few of them in order to put you on your guard against these childish notion first they say cuckoo change their nature twice a year being cuckoo in the spring and sparrowhawks the rest of the year according to this account the bird come to u from some distant country in april in it first form on the back of a kite that is so accommodating a to serve it a a mount this mode of travel is adopted by the cuckoo to spare it own wing still too weak to carry it undoubtedly the bird plumagewhich a i have told you resembles in it brown crosswise stripe on the breast the plumage of certain bird of preyhas fostered this popular belief in the changing of the cuckoo into a sparrowhawk and of the sparrowhawk into a cuckoo people have allowed themselves to be deceived by this variegated dress when the bird sings in april and may it is a cuckoo because it ha the cuckoo cry but when it fall silent in summer it becomes a sparrowhawk because it ha the plumage of one so the cuckoo is changed into a sparrowhawk and when spring come again the sparrowhawk is changed into a cuckoo once more for thousand and thousand of year this nonsense ha been believed by most people the cuckoo is a migratory bird it remains with u from april to september but departs for africa at the approach of winter to explain it reappearance in the spring some one invented the story of it being carried on the back of a kite but i need not assure you that there is not a word of truth in this fairy tale the cuckoo is always a cuckoo and it return from warmer clime on it own wing a doe the swallow another legend is that the cuckoo turn into a toad isnt that because the cuckoo when it is young and before it ha any feather is very ugly and look like a toad asked jules exactly and finally the bird is accused of discharging on plant a fatal saliva that breed insect the truth of the matter is that a tiny insect light green and shaped somewhat like a grasshopper is in the habit of pricking the stem of plant with it sucker to make the sap run and this sap present the appearance of a white foam that look like saliva the insect take it position in the midst of this cool and foamy froth to shelter itself from the heat of the sun and to drink at it leisure there you have the real fact in the case cuckoospit is the name popularly given to the insect it doe little harm to plant in reality then the supposed harmful saliva of the cuckoo is merely an ingenious mean employed by an inoffensive little creature to keep itself cool many other ridiculous story are told about the cuckoo but it would be only a waste of time to dwell on them let u get on we have already had occasion several time to speak of our doubtful helper those coworkers whose valuable service are offset by certain grave offense you have just seen how that devourer of hairy caterpillar the cuckoo is guilty of the blackest ingratitude toward the warbler it nurse in brutally throwing out of their nest the little bird which would have become model caterpillardestroyers that is a rather high price to pay for the destruction of oaktree processionary caterpillar to finish the list of these bird whose conduct deserves from an agricultural point of view both praise and blame i will tell you about the shrike a great insectdestroyer but also a barbarous slaughterer of small bird despite their diminutive sizethe largest shrike being hardly a big a a thrushthese bird have the fierce boldness of the most powerful bird of prey they will even pursue any falcon that venture near their nest their diet consists chiefly of large insect but unfortunately they also pounce on little bird greedily devouring their brain and afterward tearing their flesh to shred and eating it too for this life of rapine they have a strong hooked beak toothed toward the tip of the upper mandible and powerful talon ending in sharp nail that resemble in miniature the claw of bird of prey we have in this country four specie of shrike the common shrike is of the size of a blackbird and it plumage is ashy gray above and white underneath a wide black stripe starting from the beak continues around the eye and run down over the cheek the wing and tail are black ornamented with white the bird like to perch on lofty treetop where it keep repeating it cry of truee truee in a piercing tone in flying from tree to tree it look a if it were going to alight on the ground but presently it rise again describing a graceful curve in the air it food consists chiefly of fieldmouse and large beetle but occasionally of small bird which it catch on the wing it like to build it nest in tangled and thorny hedge and lay from four to six egg reddish in color and encircled toward the large end by a ring of brown spot similar ring are found placed in the same way on the egg of our various other shrike and furnish a distinctive and easily recognizable characteristic mark the blackheaded shrike can be recognized a it name indicates by the wide black stripe that encircles the forehead this bird is of about the lark size and ha the plumage of the common shrike except on the stomach which is reddish the egg white tinted with red have the ring at the large end formed of numerous little spot red brown or violet in color the red shrike is slightly smaller the top of it head and the back of it neck are bright red the stomach and rump white otherwise the plumage is like that of the two specie just described the redbacked shrike is the smallest and the bestknown of our shrike it is ash color on the head and rump chestnut red on the back and light red underneath a black ring encircles the eye the throat is white and the large tailfeathers and wingfeathers are black these last three shrike that i have named can at will imitate the various cry of small bird and they make use of this talent it is said to lure them to their destruction the redbacked shrike is especially expert in this it first hide in some dense shrubbery and then imitates the song of whatever specie it hears chirping in the neighborhood the imprudent one come at it call which they think proceeds from one of their own kind and the redbacked shrike pounce on them a soon a it ha them well within reach but this trick succeeds only with inexperienced little bird the older one knowing it and taking care not to be deceived the captured bird is skinned before being eaten and that is the origin of the french name écorcheur flayer given to this fourth specie of shrike the others however share this habit a they lack the faculty of rolling the feather into a ball and throwing them up after digestion a do the hornless owl these bird take the precaution to prepare the game beforehand by tearing off the skin in shred it is a quick way of plucking their victim notwithstanding it talent in imitating the call of other bird the redbacked shrike is not so lucky a to make dupe every day in case of failure the shrike content itself with common mouse fieldmouse grasshopper junebugs and fat beetle such is the shrike passion for beetle that when it ha eaten all it can it continues to hunt them just for the fun of hunting and not knowing what to do with the captured insect it impales them on the thorn of bush perhaps that is it way of stocking it larder with food and letting it acquire a strong flavor like venison a flavor much to it taste the other shrike also have this mania for laying up reserve of beetle stuck on thorn reserve which the bird doe not always come back for and which often dry up on the spot without being touched but this waste of game is of little consequence a the final result is always to our advantage we are delivered from a multitude of foe by these eager hunter when they do u such service shall we count it an unpardonable crime that they sometimes allow themselves the pleasure of feasting on little bird for my part i should be very reluctant to do so i pity with all my heart the poor little bird that foolishly let itself be caught by the shrike but i also have a lively sympathy for the beautiful tree which if bereft of it defender would soon be given over to the worm and honeycombed with hole all packed with filth the redbacked shrike frequents grove orchard and garden it nest in thick hedge sometimes in the interlacing branch of appletrees it egg are white tinged with red the ring at the large end is composed of brown gray and greenish spot in building it nest the bird us a kind of everlasting that grows abundantly in the field and ha stem all covered with a white cottonlike fluff the inside of the nest is furnished with a couch of little twig and fine rootlet interwoven and comfortably overlaid with wool down and horsehair the other shrike use in their nest the same material especially the everlasting with it white fluff the titmouse at last we come to some caterpillardestroyers that are never anything but helpful first of all there is the titmouse also known a the tomtit it is a graceful little bird lively and quicktempered always on the go flying continually from tree to tree carefully inspecting the branch hanging from the tip end of the slenderest of them in all sort of position often head downward swaying this way and that with it flexible support and never letting go it hold while it examines all bud that it suspect of containing worm and tear these bud to piece in order to get at the grub and insect egg they contain it is calculated that a titmouse consumes three hundred thousand insect egg a year and certainly few bird have larger family to provide for twenty or more little one all huddled together in the same nest are not too great a strain on the parent energy and industry the mother bird ha to examine bud and the fissure in the bark of tree in order to find grub spider caterpillar worm of every kind and feed a score of beak always open and demanding food in the bottom of the nest she come with a caterpillar the brood is all excitement twenty mouth fly open but only one receives the morsel leaving nineteen still expectant then away fly the titmouse again without an instant pause to seek more food thus back and forth she fly without rest and without weariness and by the time the twentieth mouth is fed the first one is again open and ha been open a good while clamoring for more i will leave you to guess how many worm are eaten in a day by such a household and i will also let you reach your own conclusion regarding the value of these bird a caterpillarhunters among our fruittrees complaint is made i know that they tear open the bud and destroy them but the harm they do is only apparent when they pluck a bud it is to get out some tiny larva lodged between two scale and not to harm the young leaf or flower that are forming it is better that this wormy bud should perish it would not have produced anything and the enemy lodged within it would have produced countless others to ravage the tree the next year then the titmouse doe not feed on vegetable matter asked louis no except perhaps occasionally on a few seed such a those of hemp the bird requires animal food small insect of all kind their egg and larvæ suit it best it appetite for prey is so keen that it ha the courage to attack little disabled bird or those caught in snare pecking at their skull and greedily devouring their brain it is true that the titmouse is remarkably courageous despite it smallness of size it is extremely quick and quarrelsome and a regular little ogre in time of famine it beak is conical strong short and pointed and it claw end in hooked nail designed for seizing their victim like the talon of bird of prey with these the bird grasp it food and conveys it to it beak like the parrot at the end of the brooding season the tomtit all assemble in company of one or two family each and travel together by short stage these company appear to have a leader probably the father or the mother and every now and then they are called together from one tree to another after which they separate again only to reunite once more at the leader summons their flight is short and irregular they scatter through the wood garden field and orchard inspecting tree and bush on the way and picking up larvæ and insect the titmouse family is made up of many specie we have eight in our country but i shall speak only of the principal one the coaltit is the largest being of about the redbreast size it is bluish gray on the back and yellow underneath the head is of a beautiful glossy black and a wide stripe of the same color run down the middle of the chest and stomach and around the eye which are also set off by a large white spot the large wingfeathers are edged with ashy blue this bird is very common in copse and garden and is the one we hear in autumn repeating a it examines the bark of fruittrees it cry of titipoo titipoo titipoo at time this cry ha a harsh sound like the rasping of a file and this ha given to the bird in some neighborhood the name of locksmith it nest in a hollow tree trunk lining it quarter with some soft silky material chiefly fine feather it laying consists of about fifteen white egg spotted with light red especially toward the large end it family demand not fewer than three hundred caterpillar a day or their equivalent in vermin of some sort what the gardener the nurseryman and the forester owe this valiant caterpillardestroyer by the end of the year can not be calculated yet i have seen these very person angrily thrust an arm into the hollow trunk of an old appletree to pull out the coaltits nest and throw the whole thing to the windseggs feather and little bird only a day old and they thought they were doing something worthy of praise for according to them the coaltit eats bud but i declare that the coaltit doe not eat bud it eats the little larvæ lodged in the bud scale and it instinct never allows it to molest healthy bud which contain nothing of any value to the bird leave it in peace then to pluck the wormy bud which it can very easily tell from the sound one the coaltit sometimes eats hempseed or hazelnut picking out the edible part with a dexterity of beak and clawi had almost said handpossessed by no other bird the sparrow chaffinch goldfinch and others crush the hempseed between their mandible the coaltit grasp it in it claw carry it to the beak and make in the shell a small round opening through which it pick out the meat the hazelnut is managed with the same skill the blue tit is a beautiful little bird that keep company with the coaltit and frequents orchard it is olivecolored above and yellow underneath with the top of the head an azure blue the forehead white and the cheek white framed in black a little collar of black also encircles the back and side of the neck the large feather of the tail and wing are edged with blue this titmouse so elegant in plumage so graceful in it bearing always running about over the bark of tree trunk and around the branch always hanging from the flexible bough and always pecking and searching is no whit inferior to the coaltit in it talent for catching caterpillar it ha been seen in a few hour to clear a rosebush of two thousand plantlice caterpillar and the egg of insect especially of those that attack fruit are it chief food it is very fond of little bird brain but if need be can get along with hempseed like the coaltit it nest in a hollow tree trunk it nest being nothing but a heap of small feather no other specie raise a larger family the egg are more than twenty in number white with reddish spot especially at the large end two other tomtit of le value a caterpillardestroyers build their nest with much art they are the longtailed titmouse and the penduline the first of these is different from all other tomtit in the length of it tail which form more than half the length of the body this bird life in the wood during the summer and visit our garden and orchard only in the winter it is a small bird scarcely bigger than a wren reddish gray on the back and white underneath with a tinge of red on the stomach and with white nape and cheek the nest is occasionally built in the fork of some branch in bush or hedge a few foot from the ground but oftener it is attached to the trunk of a willow or a poplar it shape is that of an elongated oval or rather an enormous cocoon enlarged at the base with an entrance on the side about an inch from the top the outside is made of lichen such a grow on old tree trunk having thus the appearance of bark and deceiving the casual observer filament of wool bind the whole compactly together the dome or roof ingeniously contrived for shedding rain is a thick felt of moss and cobweb the inside is like an oven with a bowlshaped bottom and high arched top it shape and the thick layer of soft feather lining it make the nest warm and cozy from sixteen to twenty young bird are packed into the narrow space which doe not exceed the hollow of the hand by what miracle of orderly arrangement do these twenty little creature and their mother manage to find room for themselves in this tiny abode and how can tail of such length develop there it would be impossible to find anywhere a more economical use of space how i should like to see the twenty little tomtit snuggling together in that tiny nest emile exclaimed i have had that good fortune said his uncle and even now i am strangely moved whenever i think of those twenty little head stretching up from the bottom of the nest trembling and with open beak a if their mother had come i looked for a moment through the opening of the nest at the tiny creature and then withdrew the parent were already at hand ruffling their feather with anxiety fear nothing little bird so watchful of your family uncle paul is not one to commit the crime of touching your nest nor emile either chimed in the boy nor yet jules or louis added the lastnamed i hope not indeed for otherwise uncle paul would tell you no more story the pendulines nest is still more remarkable this titmouse is found hardly anywhere except along the bank of the lower rhone it hang it nest very high from the tip of some swaying tree branch by the waterside so that it young are gently rocked by the breeze from the water the nest is a sort of oval purse about a large a a quart bottle and pierced on the side near the top by a narrow opening that would hardly admit a man thumb to enter it nest the tomtit small though it is must stretch the elastic wall which yield a little and then contract again this purseshaped abode is made of the cottonlike fluff that fly off in may from the ripe catkin of poplar and willow the bird gather this material and then weave it together with a warp of wool and hemp the resulting fabric resembles the felt of a coarse hat i am at a loss to understand how the bird manages to weave with it beak and claw a stuff superior to any that the unaided human finger could produce and yet it doe this with no instruction with no hesitation and with no hint from the work of others at it very first attempt the titmouse put to shame the studied art of our weaver and fuller the top or roof of the nest includes in it structure the tip of the branch from which it hang and also the little twig growing out of that tip end which serve a a framework for the vault but the foliage emerges from the side of the nest and furnishes shade from the sun heat finally to secure the nest more firmly cordage of wool and hemp bind the upper part to the branch and below is worked into the woof of the felt the inside is lined with poplar fluff of the best quality it take a pair of pendulines three week of the hardest work to make this marvel doesnt the rain ever get through the covering of the nest emile inquired no the felt is so thick and so closely woven that even with the hardest rain not a drop of water can leak into the cottonlined interior how comfortable the little bird must be in their snug nest the wind rock them gently over the water and from their little window they can see the river flowing below what is this clever penduline like it is ashcolored with brown wing and tail and a black stripe across the forehead it dress is simple you see a is always the case with those that posse real merit the blue tit ha rich plumage but when it come to nestbuilding it can only pile feather on top of one another at the bottom of a treehollow the penduline is of modest appearance but it build the most wonderful nest it is possible to find to each his portion talent or fine clothes all of u here choose talent declared jules never my child urged uncle paul be untrue to that sentiment we should have to forget your teaching the other replied before we could do that and what are the egg like asked emile emile is bound to have all i can tell him about the penduline doe this builder of felt nest interest you then so very much yes it doe emile assured him well the egg are quite white and rather long there are three or four of them to a nest no more than that when the other tomtit have twenty no more but to make up for it there are two laying a year the wren and the kinglet another highly talented architect past master in the building of nest is the wren known in learned language a the troglodyte if you ask me the meaning of this strange name i shall reply that it is a greek word signifying dweller in hole some inventor of name more in love with greek than desirous of being understood thought he wa doing a fine thing when he gave this big name to the little bird that worm it way into small hole a a mouse would perhaps my description will be more easily understood than his hard name the troglodyte or wren is a fluffy bunch of plumage resembling that of the woodcock with trailing wing beak to windward and tail erect over it rump it is always frisking and hopping about uttering the while it cheery cry of teederee teeree teeree i know that bird jules broke in it isnt much bigger than a walnut and every winter it come flying about the house hunting in the woodpile and in hole in the wall and darting into the thickest part of bush from a distance you would take it for a bold little rat that is it that is the wren in summer it life in densely grown wood there under the arch formed by some large upwardcurving root coated with a thick fleece of moss it build a home for itself in imitation of the pendulines nest the material it us are bit of moss which make the nest look like it support it form them into a large hollow ball with a very narrow opening on one side it is lined with feather occasionally the wren build it nest in some chimney or a pile of fagot a thick clump of ivy or a natural cavity in the bank of a shady stream the laying consists of about ten white egg dotted with red at the large end when the weather turn cold the bird leaf the wood and approach our farmhouse you can see it then always busy and on the move prying into dark hole in woodpile old wall dead tree and thick bush looking in every crack and cranny for all kind of vermin that take up their winter quarter in the fissure with which old bark is furrowed and in the crack that occur in weatherbeaten mortar to gain an idea of their unceasing activity in this sort of research you have only to watch them once a they go prying into a heap of brush flying in and out on all side of it without a moment pause for rest yes assented jules but it is so tiny a creature it cant do much work if the wren hunted big game certainly at the end of the day it would not have captured it prey by the dozen what could such a little thing do with a junebug it would not come to the end of such a supply of food for several day and the junebug would be too hard for it beak too remarked jules what it need is the smallest of caterpillar and the tiniest of gnat which make a more delicate mouthful and are better adapted to the bird small throat i need not remind you that the worst foe to our crop are the smallest a grub too tiny to catch the eye endangers our cereal and others equally small ravage our fruit while it is still in the bud how much doe it take to destroy a blossom that would produce a pear the size of your two fist one single larva just visible to the naked eye well the wren attack these tiny foe of ours that are all the more troublesome because we can not see them easily now guess how many little caterpillar a day the wren need for feeding it brood observer whose patience i admire have calculated the number let u say ten caterpillar to each little bird replied jules and ten little bird in the nest that would make a hundred caterpillar a day and it is certainly a lot a lot ah how far out you are in your reckoning the mother wren brings something to her little one at least thirtysix time an hour she feed them a mixed diet of insect larvæ and egg at the end of a day the number of insect destroyed of one kind and another amount to one hundred and fiftysix thousand that leaf your paltry hundred a long way behind my dear jules then the caterpillar must be very small or the brood of wren would die of indigestion undoubtedly they are exceedingly small and then a great many are not even hatched yet but the result a far a we are concerned is just a important so many egg devoured meaning so many ravagers the fewer a little later supposing said louis that the wren take only the worm that attack pear that would be one hundred and fiftysix thousand pear the little bird would save for u in one day evidently but that is beyond belief i admit that the result is very great in comparison with the mean employed a tiny bird that nobody notice go pecking here and there and we find that at the end of the day the caterpillareater ha destroyed either in the egg or in the nymphstage or in the final form thousand of insect which if allowed to live would have deprived u of enormous basketful of fruit and hundred of bushel of grain if we were to estimate the value of the crop saved by insectivorous bird it would be a fabulous sum leave them therefore in peace my child and do all you can to protect them for these busy little creature ward off famine from our home while we are on the subject let u speak of another little tom thumb of a bird another caterpillardestroyer a energetic a the wren it is called the kinglet that is to say the little king on account of the crown of golden yellow edged with black that encircles it head it is the smallest of our bird it is olivecolored above and yellowishwhite beneath it beautiful crown feather can stand up like a crest the kinglet breed in the cold country of europe and especially in the fir forest of norway it nest is a little ball no bigger than your fist open at the top artistically fashioned outside with moss wool and spider web and lined with the softest down it rest flat on some fir branch at an inaccessible height the egg from six to eight in number are of a uniform flesh color although very delicate in appearance the kinglet stand the cold with great hardihood it come to u from the land of it birth in small flock when the autumnal fog are gathering and the leaf are falling these flock of five or six bird at most scatter through the wood public promenade and orchard to examine the crack in bark to explore the heap of dead leaf and to inspect the bud while clinging to the tip of the smallest branch not even the tomtit show itself a more expert gymnast in hanging with head downward and working in all sort of attitude the task of destroying caterpillar is accompanied by a continual little rallying cry zeezeezee zeezeezee the kinglet ha great confidence in mankind with no sign of fear even when within hearing of the footstep and conversation of person walking about it continues it evolution it hunting it zeezeezee it will let one come close almost near enough to reach out a hand and take hold of it but the knowing little creature although it appears not to see you because it is so busy dart suddenly away and mount to the upper branch to carry on it work at a safer distance swallow we have whole tribe of helper that devote themselves to the patient search for insect egg in the crack of tree bark and in pile of dead leaf for larvæ between the scale of bud and in the wormhole in wood and for insect lurking in narrow crevice where they hide from their pursuer these invaluable assistant of ours embrace the magpie nuthatch wryneck climber tomtit wren kinglet and many others in the kind of hunting here referred to the bird is not obliged to chase the game to vie with it in swiftness it is enough to know how to find it in it hidingplace for this a sharp eye and a slender beak are necessary wing are only of secondary importance but now we come to other specie of bird that hunt in the air chase their game on the wing pursuing gnat and fly and butterfly moth and mosquito and beetle they require a short beak but one that open very wide and is pretty sure to catch insect a they flya beak in fine that may be depended on to work almost of itself and without an instant pause in the bird flight a beak that above all is so sticky inside that a soon a an insect wing graz this viscous lining it is caught fast in the gluelike substance the beak of the bat that other hunter of insect on the wing the bat beak i say opening from ear to ear may serve a a model in respect to the width of it opening but above all else the hunter must have swift wing that never tire that can fly a fast a the prey which is trying so hard to escape that can follow the bewildering zigzag of a moth manœuvering to save it life a cleft beak that open wide and wing that are strong and tirelesssuch must be the equipment of the bird that pursues it prey in the open air chief among these hunter is the swallow which may be called the daylight bat a the bat is the twilight swallow both chase flying insect following them in their endless dodging and doubling and snapping them up with yawning beak then passing on without an instant delay to the pursuit of others but how much more pleasing in appearance how much swifter in flight is the swallow than that hunter the sadlooking bat while we may compare their work and their way of hunting we can not compare them in anything else buffon quote guéneau de montbéliard a saying the air is the swallow appropriate element and it is the nature of the bird to be ever on the wing it eats flying bathe flying and sometimes even feed it young when flying it glide through the air with no effort with perfect ease conscious of being in it own domain it explores aërial space in all it dimension a if to enjoy it to the utmost and it delight in the act is expressed by little cry of rapture it may be seen giving chase to flying insect and following with supple agility their evasive and tortuous course or it may leave one to pursue another and snap up a third in passing or again it lightly skim the surface of land and water to catch any that may be gathered there for the sake of coolness and moisture or finally it may in it turn be driven to flee with all speed before the lightninglike onset of some bird of prey always in full control of it movement even when flying at topmost speed it is continually changing it course describing in the air a bewildering maze whose path cross interlace recede from and approach one another meet wind ascend descend interweave and mingle in a thousand different way and after a plan so complicated a to defy representation to the eye by the art of drawing and scarcely to lend itself to description for the imagination through the medium of speech we have three kind of swallow in france of which the best known is the martin black above with glint of blue and white beneath and on the rump it build it nest in windowcorners under the eaves of roof and on the cornice of building the material it us are fine soil chiefly that which is deposited by earthworm after digestion in little mound over our field and garden the swallow carry it a beakful at a time mix it with a little viscous saliva to make it stick together and lay it by course until it take the shape of a hemisphere attached to the wall and provided with a small opening at the top bit of straw give additional firmness to the masonry and finally the interior is lined with an abundance of little feather the laying consists of four or five pure white egg without any spot the nest are used year after year by the same pair of bird being recognized by them on their annual return in the spring and made a good a new with a few repair if some are left vacant by reason of the owner death in distant land new couple profit by the fact dont they ever quarrel over the old nest asked jules very seldom swallow like to live in colony and their nest touch one another sometimes to the number of hundred on the same cornice each couple recognizes it own nest without the slightest hesitation and scrupulously respect others property in order to have it own respected there is among them a deep feeling of joint responsibility and they help one another with a much intelligence a zeal occasionally it happens that a nest is no sooner finished than it give way either because the mortar used is not strong enough or because the mason were in too great a hurry and had not the patience to let one course dry before laying another or for some other reason on hearing of the disaster the neighbor hasten to console the unlucky pair and help them to rebuild all set to work bringing the best mortar straw and feather and in fortyeight hour the nest is rebuilt left to themselves it would have taken the owner a fortnight to repair the damage thats the kind of friend in need i like to see declared emile but i have something still better to tell you let u suppose a swallow ha been so careless a to become entangled in a mesh of loose thread and the more frantically it struggle to escape the more firmly it bind it fetter with wing and claw held fast it is in danger of perishing uttering piteous cry it call on it comrade for help all hasten to give aid noisily making plan for relief and working away with beak and talon until they finally unsnarl the tangle and free the captive the happy event is then celebrated with chirpings of delight that is what i saw with my own eye right here in the garden one day when mother ambroisine wa bleaching some of the linen thread she spin on her distaff an author 6 of note tell u that he once witnessed something similar these are his word i saw a swallow that had unfortunately i know not how caught it foot in a slipknot tied in a string the other end of which wa fastened to a roof gutter the bird strength wa exhausted and it hung cry from the end of the string with an occasional effort to escape all the swallow in the neighborhood had assembled to the number of several thousand they formed a veritable cloud each one uttering cry of alarm and pity after considerable hesitation one of them hit on a plan for freeing their luckless companion and communicated it to the others whereupon they all set to work a space wa cleared and every swallow within hail came one after another a in a ringgame and gave in passing a peck at the string these blow all delivered at the same point followed one another with only a second interval or le half an hour of this work sufficed to sever the thread and liberate the prisoner but the entire company of bird with a few exception stayed there until night chattering away incessantly though no longer in anxious tone but rather a if in mutual congratulation and animated comment again an insolent sparrow invades a swallow nest and like it so well it wish to stay the owner assail the intruder but the latter having a stronger beak and being also protected by the rampart of the nest easily repulse their attack ha so you wont budge then well see about that one of the two swallow remains to hold the blockade while the other go for help the neighbor hasten to the spot consider the situation deliberate on mean to be employed and finally conclude that it is out of the question to hope to dislodge by force an enemy so securely entrenched in the nest a in a strong redoubt there is but one opinion the invader can not be ousted from the nest but the proprietor must at least be avenged no sooner said than done while a few courageous one posted at the opening intimidate the interloper with their cry the others fetch a supply of their usual mortar soil moistened with saliva and little by little close the entrance to the nest who wa the fool that time cried jules in high delight it certainly wa the sparrow sealed up in it narrow prison and left to perish caught you nestrobber emile exclaimed clapping his hand the chimneyswallow or houseswallow also called barnswallow ha chestnutred forehead throat and eyebrow a black back with violet sheen and a white breast and stomach it name of houseswallow is given to it because it seek man neighborhood and even nest inside our house especially where there is but little commotion or noise open and empty room shed and coachhouses the eaves of roof the under side of balcony floor and the inside of tall chimney are it chosen nestingplaces the nest itself is made of moistened clay mixed with straw and hay and furnished inside with feather and dry grass it is in the shape of a halfcup wide open at the top the egg are five in number white with small brown and violet spot the houseswallow is the most interesting of the tribe it is the farmer cheery companion and the guest of the barn while the martin prefers town and the cornice of monument it characteristic cry is a sweet little song which the father perched on the edge of the nest keep repeating to the brooding mother to beguile the long hour of incubation this bird is found all over the world it reach u after a long migration about the first of april twelve day before the martin and a month ahead of the swift the sandmartin is smaller and of le frequent occurrence than the other two swallow of which we are speaking it back is mousegray in color a are also it cheek and a wide stripe across the chest while breast and stomach are pure white with it beak and clawspoor tool for such rough work did not energetic good will supply the deficiencyit tunnel into steep sandbank by the waterside or into the face of cliff and the wall of quarry making a hole with a narrow entrance and extending in a winding passage for nearly two foot at the further end a little space is hollowed out and furnished with a thick bed of straw dry grass and feather all heaped together with no art there are laid five or six slightly translucent white egg the sandmartin perch only on rock to which it cling easily with it long and pointed claw it haunt the water edge which it explores in rapid flight darting to and fro and snapping up the gnat attracted by the coolness it is said remarked jules that swallow take long journey yes all our swallow migrate every year not from a love of wandering but from necessity many other bird particularly those that live on insect do the same swallow like bat live entirely on flying insect and when cold weather come these are lacking what doe the bat do then to keep from starving it go to sleep answered emile yes it close a tightly a it can the draft in the vital stovethat natural stove you know that give u heat movement and animation by burning up our blood with the help of air the bat almost stop it breath in order to economize the fuel stored up in it little vein and make it last until the reappearance of insect at the approach of summer in a word it go to sleep in the depth of some grotto falling into an unconsciousness resembling death bird however can not thus save their fuel their little stove are always burning away under forced draft because of the violent exercise of flying their temperature summer and winter is fortytwo degree centigrade whereas man is only thirtyeight when such a fire ha to be kept going imagine if you can take a six month nap because there wa nothing to eat in the larder it is quite out of the question what then do bird do unable to do a the bat doe they form a bold resolve they leave their native land which is about to be stripped of flying insect by the cold and go far away sad to leave but not without the hope of returning some day they migrate the strong helping the weak the old and muchtraveled one guiding the young and inexperienced they form in flock and fly southward to africa where abundant food and a warmer sun await them with no compass but instinct to direct their course they cross the sea the vast expanse of water in which only an occasional islet offer them a haltingplace many perish in the crossing and many arrive faint with hunger and spent with fatigue but they do arrive at last it must be a trying time for the swallow when the day for starting come jules observed a very trying time indeed for the bird ha to tear itself away from it beloved haunt the place where it wa born to face the fatigue and danger of a tremendous journey a journey never before taken by the greater number of the emigrant in a general assembly the date of departure is fixed for about the end of august in the case of martin and sandmartins and later even a late a october for houseswallows this being arranged the martin gather for several successive day on the roof of high building every now and then small group detach themselves from the rest and circle about in the air with anxious cry taking a last look at their birthplace and bidding it farewell then they return to their companion and we may imagine fall to chattering about their hope and fear a they prepare for the journey by a careful examination of their plumage which they oil a feather at a time after several repetition of these touching farewell a plaintive twittering announces the fateful hour they must start launching themselves on their desperate adventure they take flight in a body toward the south houseswallows when the time for their departure approach hold a consultation on some leafless tree and almost always in the rain the emigrating flock number three or four hundred bird swift and nightjar the swift is that large black swallow that fly in flock on summer evening and utters a shrill cry a it pass hunting insect on the wing is it occupation it ha a very short beak that open wide a big gullet always coated with a glue that hold the captured game long and pointed wing which enable it to cover in continuous flight eighty league an hour and piercing eye capable of seeing a gnat at a hundred meter distance or even farther every insect that venture into the upper air is lost the swift open beak is a living trap a trap that advance rapidly to swallow up the tiny prey if the bird ha little one it sometimes stows away it prey in it cheekpouches and when they are full return to it nest to feed these provision to the hungry mouth waiting to be filled discharging through it beak the accumulated fly moth and beetle what a slaughter of twilightflying insect take place when the screaming flock of swift fly hither and thither circling about in the calm glow of sunset what an onrush of whirring wing what dash and eagerness how animated the scene some fly merely a chance dictate letting themselves glide gently through the air for the mere pleasure of the motion others describe intertwining circle without number others again soar aloft on motionless wing or let themselves fall from dizzy height a if wounded and helpless still others follow a straight course racing toward some distant goal and then returning for a fresh start and finally there are those that go whirling in noisy company about some lofty building but what of this one that dart across our vision in such hot haste it flash past with three stroke of the wing and is lost in the haze of the distance what impetuosity child what amazing speed i have often wished i could fly when i wa watching those bird said emile if i only had their wing to carry me to those blue mountain we see from here how i should like to go flying to the top of that highest peak and then come back a quickly a i went that wish my boy is common to u all every one must envy the swift it wing but certainly no one would ever think of envying it it foot why because they are so misshapen and the leg are so short that they can not be used for walking all four toe point forward that tell you the swift doe not perch being unable to grasp the supporting branch but must cling to wall for a brief rest after which it must take flight again starting with a falling movement a bat do guéneau de montbéliard tell u this swift have to be on the wing a great part of the time they never voluntarily alight on the ground and if by some accident they fall to earth they can not rise again into the air without extreme difficulty by dragging themselves up on to a little mound or by climbing with beak and claw upon a stone from which they can spread their long wing if the ground is quite level they either lie prone on the stomach or sway from side to side with a balancing motion or they manage to struggle forward a little by beating the earth with their wing after repeated effort they sometimes succeed in flying off the earth therefore is to them a great danger that must be avoided with the utmost care any state between swift motion and absolute rest is hardly possible with them violent exercise in the air and perfect quiet in their place of retreatthese two a a rule make up their existence the only variation known to them is to hang on to some wall near their hole and then drag themselves into the nest by clambering along with the help of beak and any chance support that they can find usually they enter their retreat in full flight after passing and repassing it entrance more than a hundred time all at once they dart in so quickly that they are lost to sight before you know whither they are gone you feel almost inclined to believe they have vanished into thin air their nest is nearly always placed in a deep hole in the wall and at a great height it is made of hemp thread little wisp of tow bit of straw feather rag and cottonlike down from poplar and willow catkin these material are stuck together with the viscous saliva that constantly ooze from the swift throat and serf a glue to entangle captured insect the bird spread it over the nest and thoroughly moistens the successive layer in drying this saliva hardens and take on the shiny appearance of gum giving consistency and even elasticity to the whole structure if you squeeze the nest between your two hand it will shrink up without breaking and when the pressure is removed it will resume it former shape the swift then furnishes it own adhesive cement but whence doe it obtain the other material it need such a tow rag straw and feather of course it is not so foolish a to go and pick them up from the ground where it might find them a other bird do for if it touched the ground it would certainly come to grief therefore it resort to cunning a it reach u rather late in the season it take advantage of such hole a it find already abandoned by the sparrow and there it find abundant material which it us in it own way by sticking them together with it glue if the sparrow have not yet broken up housekeeping it boldly invades their nest steal bit of flock and tuft of hair straw and feather a little from one and a little from another and make with these it own nest in another hole in the same wall the female lay from two to four egg pure white and rather elongated swift seldom stay more than three month with u arriving after the swallow early in may they leave at the end of july the whitebreasted swift differs from the bird i have just described in being larger and having a white breast and stomach it is found in the region of the alp and of the pyrenees and frequents the mediterranean shore especially where the wave beat against high steep cliff middle and northern europe are not visited by this bird it flight is even swifter than that of it black cousin and it fly habitually at a great height descending only when bad weather threatens it build it nest at the summit of high steep rock making it of straw and moss stuck together with the glue from it own throat the nightjar closely resembles the swift having like that bird a short beak which is very broad at the base and open very wide while from the gullet come a sticky saliva for holding fast any insect that are caught it size is about that of the thrush it plumage is light soft and shaded with gray and brown it eye are large and prominent and very sensitive to light the base of it beak bristle with long stiff hair and it leg are short but at the same time not ill adapted to walking a indicated by the sensitiveness of it eye which can not endure the full light of day and by the softness and lightness and gray color of it plumage which resembles that of the hornless owl the nightjar is a twilight bird it is the swift of the evening flying and hunting only when the sun is near setting by the fading light of a summer evening it may be seen scanning the ground in low flight to and fro over it surface after the manner of the swallow it fly with mouth wide open so that the air in striking the throat produce a low and continuous humming like that of a spinningwheel and is it from that humming sound that it get it name of nightjar asked jules precisely but it doe not make this humming sound for the mere love of hearing it it object is to snap up the twilightflying insect a it pass with distended beak big beetle sporting in the evening air junebugs and other plump winged creature disappear in the viscous gullet while small butterfly moth gnat and mosquito become entangled by the dozen in the fatal glue if the game is large the bird swallow it at once whole and still alive if small it wait until it ha caught a certain number and then swallow them all in one mouthful but doe it really swallow big beetle and junebugs alive emile asked you can readily understand that in it headlong chase the bird ha no time to dismember it captive pouncing upon the insect with wideopen beak snapping it up and gulping it downall this it doe a it fly without a moment pause no sooner is the plumpest prey captured than down it go alive and struggling into the bird crop a dozen of that sort of game must stir up a big rumpus in the bird crop wa emile opinion almost any other creature in the nightjar place would have it digestion ruined by a brisk company of coleopters kicking about in the stomach and tickling it wall with their rough and prickly leg but i am inclined to believe the bird ha the mean of quieting them immediately by smothering them with it digestive juice a it carry on the business of stuffing it crop with large live beetle it ought to know the secret of how to prevent their making a hole in it stomach but that doe not lessen my admiration for it digestive power no creature enjoys a more remarkable immunity from dyspepsia on a near view the nightjar is not a pretty bird it flat skull it tremendously yawning beak which seems to split the whole head in two it wideopen gullet red and slimy and powdered with the remains of moth recently devoured it large and prominent eyesall these give it somewhat the appearance of a toad that is why it is sometimes called the flying toad another common name for it is goatsucker based on a false belief a to one of it habit it like to visit pasture and sheepfold where it chase the beetle to be found there noting it frequent appearance among the sheep and goat shepherd imagined it came there to suck their milk if they had watched it more closely they would have seen the absurdity of any such notion a bird suck what nonsense but the more ridiculous an idea is the more likely it is to spread and the absurd name of goatsucker is better known in many place than the appropriate and expressive one of nightjar this bird come to u from warmer land toward the beginning of may and leaf u in september it build no nest imitating in this various nocturnal bird of prey some hole in the ground or among broken stone at the foot of a tree or a rock and usually taken just a it happens to be suffices to hold the bird egg which are two or three in number white with tawny and bluish spot in closing let me beg you to remember what we owe these bigthroated bird that hunt insect on the wing and more especially the swift and swallow who defend our granary and garden our wardrobe and our very person what would you think of any one who possessing the terrible secret of creating by the bushel moth gnat mosquito weevil and other destructive insect should let loose a swarm of these creature in the air about u i should say hanging wa too good for him answered louis but that is exactly what any one doe who kill a swallow it is true he doe not create moth and mosquito and other insect but he save the life of those that the swallow would have eaten and thus he is guilty of a grave an offense a if he had created them on purpose to turn them loose on u he doe a wicked deed for he receives with deadly shotgun the pretty joyous creature messenger of spring and sunshine that come trustfully asking his hospitality and the permission to build it nest under the eaves of his house he cause famine for he encourages the multiplication of those devouring horde that levy every year on our farm product a tax that amount to thousand of million of franc in it total sum and is constantly increasing a insecteating bird decrease a wicked deed i say a deed which cause faminethat is what is really done by the murderer of swallow the bird beak there are many other small bird that live almost exclusively on insect and in so doing render a great service to agriculture a full account of them all would take too long and besides you are familiar with the greater number seeing them daily in the wood field orchard and garden i will confine myself therefore to the chief difference between insecteaters and bird that live on seed and grain and then a glance at some of the habit of the most important specie will complete our rapid review the food of small bird fall into two class seed and insect certain bird require millet hempseed pip and similar seed of all kind while others need grub larvæ insect the choice of one or the other sort of food is determined by the shape of the beak just a a mammal diet depends on the structure of the animal teeth the molar of the horse and the ox call for forage to grind under their flat wide crown but those of the wolf and the cat with their sharp edge need flesh to cut to piece in the same manner the bird beak according to whether it is shaped this way or that whether large or small thick or slender strong or weak requires hard seed that crack under the mandible and in opening yield their kernel or the tender grub that is swallowed without having to be crushed show me your teeth we said to the mammal and i shall know what you eat show me your beak we might now say to the bird and i shall know whether you live on insect or seed the beak of the bird that life on seed or grainthat is the granivorous birdis thick conical wide at the base and strong in proportion to the hardness of the seed it ha to crack open but the beak of the bird that life on insectsthat is the insectivorous birdis thin slender delicate and weak in proportion to the softness of the insect it catch in our everyday speech we note this difference by applying to the small granivorous bird the general designation grosbeak while the insecteaters are often called slenderbeaked bird let u remember these two expressive word and formulate the general principle thus seed for the grosbeak worm for the slender beak and now without further delay we will put the rule into practice here is a bird whose diet is perhaps a matter of uncertainty to you if i ask you what to judge from the shape of it beak is it customary food shall you be at a loss how to reply that strong beak so wide at the base must be meant for crunching the very hardest seed wa juless opinion yes emile chimed in that bird certainly life on seed it is written all over it big face it is indeed a consumer of all kind of seed it is the greenfinch of our copse greenish underneath and with a yellow border to it tail the dominant color of it costume green mixed with yellow ha given it the name of greenfinch and this one seed for the grosbeak worm for the slender beak repeated emile the beak ha no strength it is rather long but thin the bird is an insecteater and one of the greediest for it belongs to the family of warbler those delightful songster that would be afraid of getting hoarse if they ate dry farinaceous grain to keep their vocal cord flexible these artist must have the gentle lubricant furnished by caterpillar and the succulent flesh of larvæ they take good heed not to touch coarse seed which would injure the voice this bird is the reedwarbler which life on dragonfly small junebugs mosquito and horsefly snapping them up on the wing it build it nest among the reed in willow thicket it is reddish brown above and yellowish white underneath finally let u look at this third one another slender beak said emile another insecteater yes you see it isnt difficult the bird ha three name among u washerwoman wagtail and little shepherdess washerwoman because it frequents the waterside in company with those that wash linen wagtail because it wag it tail at every step it take and little shepherdess because it like the society of shepherd and flock it is ashcolored above white underneath and black on the back of the head and also on the throat and breast wagtail go hopping along in a lively manner over the sand at the water edge looking for little worm every now and then they fly up a few foot into the air balance pirouette and alight again on some slight elevation they may also be seen skipping across the field among the sheep and standing on the back of the latter even in the shepherd presence in order to get the parasitic insect lurking under the wool they live on small slug moth fly and larvæ midway between bird eating only seed and those eating only insect must be placed in respect to their food those that have a mixed diet and eat according to season place and circumstance insect and seed larvæ and berry their beak ha neither a strong conical structure like that of purely granivorous bird nor a delicately slender form like the beak of the insecteaters but is between these two extreme this beak instrument of general utility is found in the lark that bringer of gladness to our plowed field in the thrush and the blackbird lover of grape and juniperberries but not le fond of insect in the oriole that superb black and yellow bird so appreciative of cherry flavored with toothsome larvæ and in the starling devourer of fig grape insect slug and various kind of seed the starling is a magnificent bird almost a large a a blackbird brilliant with glint of metallic luster on a dark background it color is black with greenish sheen on head and wing and violet on breast and back most of the feather are adorned with a reddishwhite spot at the very end it nest under the roof of building in dovecote and in hollow tree trunk the nest composed on the outside of straw and within of dry grass and feather contains four spotless whitish egg starling come to u in the autumn they fly in large flock whirling about like grain winnowed in a sieve and sending forth piercing cry from high up in the air they alight in marsh and damp meadow where they destroy much vermin insectivorous bird now let u go back to the principal slenderbeaked bird eater of insect only and consequently our greatest helper they are all small in size delicately and gracefully formed and modest in dress among them we find the sweet singer that make the wood echo in spring with the refreshing song of the opening season first there is the nightingale clothed all in brown except the under part which are whitish in color listen to it some calm evening in may all is quiet so we need not lose a note of the bird hymn it begin with a few timid and tentative phrase thus teoooo teoooo teoooo teoooo shpe teoooo tokooa then it becomes more animated teo teo teo teo teo kooooteoo kooooteoo kooooteoo kooooteoo tskooo tskooo tskooo tskooo tseeee tseeee tseeee tseeee tseeee tseeee here the phrasing becomes more marked the melody quicker dlo dlo dlo dlo dlo dlo kooeoo trrrrrrritz lululu lelelele leeleeleelee enthusiasm then burst all bound and the bird indulges in the most brilliant roulade but our harsh alphabet is powerless to show the sound that come from this wonderful throat the nightingale say buffon begin with a timid prelude in weak and almost wavering tone a if wishing to try it instrument and win the attention of those within hearing but presently gaining assurance it gradually becomes animated and display all the resource of it incomparable organ burst of melody lively volley of rippling song in which clearness is equaled only by volubility low and voiceless murmur inaudible to the listener but calculated to increase the brilliance of the note about to be heard vivid and rapid trill that sweep the gamut and are articulated with force and even with a certain hardness of effect not unpleasing to the ear plaintive cadence softly modulated note struck without art but full of soul enchanting and poignant chord that seem to come from the very heart and to convey a touching significancesuch are the impassioned strain by which in a tongue doubtless full of sentiment this natural songster appears to try to charm it mate or rather to contend before her with his jealous rival for the prize of supreme excellence in song i have seen unfeeling barbarian cut short this pretty romance with a shot from a gun they say that half a dozen nightingale make an excellent broiled dish horror what a frightful brute is man when he think of nothing but his stomach the nightingale build it nest in bush and rather near the ground sometimes even among the root coarse grass and oak leaf are used for the outside tuft of fleece and horsehair for the inside the female lay five darkgreen egg with the nightingale though le wonderful a singer are to be classed the warbler thirty or more specie of which can be counted in europe all live on fly caterpillar small beetle spider and larvæ of various kind their nest are constructed with much art some nest in tree and hedge in our garden others prefer thicket and lonely grove still others choose hole in tree trunk and wall others again build on piling that project above the water in marsh that is they unite three or four slender reed with a ligature and build their nest on this swaying support others finally content themselves with a little hole in the ground among the bestknown of these bird is the blackcapped warbler so named on account of the black hood that cover the top of the head and the nape of the neck you remember it is one of the cuckoo victim a wa proved by the egg found a few day ago in the nest at the foot of the garden then we must include the babbling warbler lover of copse orchard and garden the little red warbler which visit our fruittrees and say zipzap zipzap zipzap the marshwarbler which build it nest among the marsh reed and the alpine warbler guest of chalet and tuneful songster of high snowy mountain now let u look at the fallowfinch or whitetail which fly from clod to clod in our fallow field whence it name of fallowfinch and in flying spread it white tail a target for the huntsman and the reason for it second name it is ashcolored on the back and reddish white underneath with black wing and eyebrow it frequents cultivated field to catch the grub turned up by the plow it nest placed under a clod of turf amid a pile of stone or in a hole in some dry wall is made of moss grass and feather the egg five or six in number are light blue the fallowfinchs chosen haunt are dry rocky upland where it may be seen in the autumn in large flock flying from one rock to another and from one clod to another keeping close to the ground by the fallowfinchs side let u place the stonechat a little lively active bird always seen perched on the topmost branch of a bush or bramble where it repeat with frisky movement it short cry of ooistratra ooistratra if from this place of observation it see an insect on the ground it fly down seizes it and return in a trice to it perch by a short curving flight like that so characteristic of the shrike it plumage is brown with red breast and black throat the side of the neck together with the wing and the rump are ornamented with white stonechat frequent hedge that border sown field and dry pasture and are never seen any more than are fallowfinches in damp land along the bank of river they build their nest in which they lay five or six greenishblue egg among the root of bush in crevice in rock and among pile of stone i should count it almost a crime to omit here the robin redbreast in my opinion the most pleasing of our smaller bird in it wideawake manner it gentle look and it friendly curiosity which make it come and pick up the shepherd crumb when he is eating his lunch at the first dawn of day it begin it lively song uttering now and then a note or two that recall certain part of the nightingale more elaborate performance who doe not know it alert cry from the depth of some clump of bush treet teereeteeteet teereet teereeteeteet and it call to some passing member of it kin ooeep ooeep the redbreast is greenish brown above bright red on the throat and breast and white on the stomach it nest in the densest wood amid the mossgrown tree root and it nest made of leaf horsehair tuft of wool and feather contains from five to seven whitish egg spotted with red in winter the redbreast leaf the forest draw near our farm and even venture into our house in quest of food god forbid boy that you should ever betray it confidence when on a stormy winter day it come discreetly tapping with it beak on the windowpane asking hospitality welcome the poor little famished creature and it will pay you a hundred time over with it gentle warbling and it zeal in defending the fruit of the earth but enough about the slenderbeaks you ought by this time to appreciate the immense help we receive from these legion of insecteaters which share the work of the field hedge meadow garden wood and orchard and wage incessant warfare on every sort of vermin that would destroy our harvest unless others than ourselves were constantly on the watchothers cleverer and endowed with sharper eyesight and greater patience for the unending hunt and also having nothing else to do i am not exaggerating i assure you without our insectivorous bird we should soon suffer from famine who then except an idiot with a mania for destruction would dare touch the nest of these bird of the good god that enliven the countryside with their varied plumage and protect u from insect there are i well know unruly boy who tired of their book and lesson delight to play truant and make a pastime of climbing tree and searching hedge in order to toss the newborn bird out of their nest to a miserable death and to smash the egg the rural guard is on the watch for these wicked thief and the law punishes them that our field and orchard may enjoy the bird protection and continue to produce their sheaf and their fruit granivorous bird it might at first seem that i ought to be a lenient toward those who hunt granivorous bird a i have just shown myself severe toward the destroyer of insectivorous bird for can it be denied that bird given to a vegetable diet are harmful to our crop that they plunder our grainfield and devour great quantity of seed bud fruit and young garden plant some of them know how to extract the wheat grain from the ear and others boldly come to get their share of the oat thrown to the poultry in our barnyard others again prefer the juicy flesh of fruit and know before we do when cherry are ripe or pear are mellow so that when we come to gather in the harvest all that we find is merely what they have left there are even some that have a queershaped beak for splitting fruit open and dividing it into quarter so a to get at the pip which are to them the very choicest of titbit look at this one beak and tell me if you have ever seen a more singular tool the two mandible cross each other said jules instead of meeting they go crisscross like the blade of an old pair of scissors out of order what can such a rickety beak be good for emile asked with it tip pointing one up and the other down it will never be able to pick up a seed from the ground consequently it doe not get it food from the ground it manner of proceeding is more complicated first i will say that the bird is known a a crossbill from the position of the two mandible this odd arrangement is not the result of an accident to the bird a for instance a sprain following some violent effort it is not a crippled beak nor is it a rickety beak a emile call it but a beak in it natural and perfect state the bird is born with this odd beak and ha never had any other it is even extremely doubtful whether it would consent to make a change if it had the opportunity so useful a tool is this beak for the work it ha to do the crossbill ha a fondness for pine seed above all other food take a pinecone and lift the scale with the point of a penknife you will find behind each scale two seed full of oil and smelling slightly of resin they are the titbit the bird is after but how get at them under scale so hard and so firmly held in place in vain would the grosbeak hammer at these scale with it strong tool it would never succeed in opening them even we ourselves with the aid of a knife find it difficult but the crossbill make play of this hard work it insert the tip of one mandible under the scale and using the other a a fulcrum pry with a turning movement until the scale is lifted and the seed laid bare and the whole thing is done in next to no time a key turning in the lock doe not push the bolt more easily i must change my mind jules acknowledged about this beak that at first seemed to me so awkward it is a firstrate key to force the lock of a pinecone and it is not le useful proceeded his uncle in quartering apple and getting out the pip i should not like to have crossbill by the dozen in any orchard of mine they would soon tear all the fruit to piece fortunately it is not our level plain that these bird choose a their haunt but cold mountainous region covered with dark forest of conebearing evergreen their plumage is bright red more or le tinged with green and yellow crossbill breed in the coldest country of europe and build their nest even in midwinter their material are moss and lichen made to shed the melting snow by a coating of resin i shall enter no plea for the crossbill it taste for apple and pear seed is a serious matter but i will mention certain thing that seem to plead for the granivorous bird a a class first the greater number of these bird feed on wild seed of no value to u even if not actually harmful to our cultivated field we weed our tilled land clearing it of all plant that exhaust it to no purpose many granivorous bird also weed in their own way they gather the seed that would otherwise infest the soil for example must we not acknowledge the service of the goldfinch which when thistle have matured alights on their prickly head and search for the seed amid the thistledown i need not describe this pretty little bird so well is it known to you all it ha a splash of red on it head said emile with yellow black and white on it wing yes that is the goldfinch it nest which is one of the most carefully built to be found anywhere is placed in the fork of some flexible branch the outside consists of moss and lichen with a padding of down from thistle and other plant bearing seed that have silky tuft a for example the groundsel and the dandelion the inside artistically rounded is lined with a thick layer of horsehair wool and feather the egg five or six in number are white with reddishbrown spot chiefly at the large end the goldfinch merit our gratitude it cheer u with it singing and work diligently at weeding land infested with thistle and groundsel i will say a much in favor of the linnet which feed on all kind of small seed in our field and to that extent follows the honorable trade of weeding at the same time i will not hide it liking for linseed which ha given it the name it bear it is very fond of hempseed also but hemp and flax are not found everywhere and the bird manages to get along very well without them by gathering a quantity of other seed more or le harmful to agriculture it like to breed in hilly country choosing some thickly grown junipertree or bush it nest contains five or six white egg with red spot it plumage is brown with a dash of crimson on head and breast to the part of weeder seedeating bird add a second even more praiseworthy one seed it is true furnish their customary food but most of the bird devour a great number of insect when these are plentiful and easy to find if they lack the patience to hunt for worm in their most hidden retreat with the painstaking care of the slenderbeaks they at least profit by those that fortune place within their reach a few grub to season their regular diet of seed are a godsend to them and moreover their favorite seed may by some mischance be lacking in their neighborhood not every day can the goldfinch find thistleseeds nor the linnet flaxseed what then is to be done except to have patience and in the meantime eat insect last but not least in their young day when weak and featherless they are fed from the parent beak many granivorous bird are brought up on insect the reason is plain enough you can readily understand that the delicate crop of a young bird just out of the shell ha not the strength to digest hard dry seed it must have something more nourishing something smaller and above all more succulent such a a marmalade of grub prepared in the mother beak a few day later with the first growth of down will come little soft caterpillar served whole then tougher insect will prepare the stomach for the more difficult digestion of seed i select a few example at random the chaffinch the gay chaffinch is well known to be a granivorous bird a lover of millet and hempseed now what doe it give it little one while they are still in the nest it give them hairless caterpillar and tender larvæ chosen a being the easiest food to digest i can say the same of the greenfinch a bird with plumage midway between green and yellow of the bullfinch known by it red breast and stomach and of the various bunting that come in the winter in flock pecking around our strawstacks these last however feed perhaps more than the others on seed a they have on the inside of the upper mandible a small hard excrescence intended expressly for crushing them i might add to these example but prefer to conclude with a bird that is one of the most familiar to you the sparrow here certainly we have an undoubted seedeater it raid our dovecote and poultryyards and steal the food of our pigeon and poultry it go aharvesting in the grainfield before our reaper have begun their task a great many other misdeed are laid at it door it strip cherrytrees plunder our garden forage for sprouting seed regales itself on young lettuce and nip the first little leaflet of green pea but when hatchingtime come this bold pilferer is transformed into a helper inferior to none at least twenty time an hour the father and the mother by turn bring a mouthful to their young one and each time it consists of either a caterpillar or an insect large enough to require quartering or perhaps a larva a fat a butter or it may be a grasshopper or some other small game in one week the brood consumes about three thousand insect including larvæ caterpillar and grub of all kind i have counted in the immediate vicinity of a single nest of these bird the remains of seven hundred junebugs besides small insect without number behold what a store of food is needed for raising only one brood what quantity of vermin then must all the brood of a community devour after such service let him who will presume to raise a hand against our sparrow a for me i leave them in peace a long a they do not become too troublesome my closing word is this eater of seed and eater of insect grosbeak and slenderbeaks some in greater degree some in le all come to our aid peace then to the little bird the joy of the countryside and the protector of our crop snake and lizard i propose today to undertake the defense of reptile which many people fear and dislike even look upon with horror i have shown you what service are rendered by bat despite the repugnance we feel for them these animal regarded by u a hideous and treated a enemy i have brought you to look upon a valuable helper veritable swallow of the night devoted to the extermination of twilight insect a soon a reason illuminates the darkness of prejudice the detested creature is found to be a very useful animal in like manner i shall now try to make you separate the false from the true in respect to the reptile let u begin with the snake if to explain our dislike for bat we mention their strange and repulsive appearance we have not the same excuse in regard to snake their slender form is not lacking in grace the suppleness they display in their undulating movement is pleasing to the eye and their scaly skin is decorated with welldefined color that are prettily arranged our aversion then must be otherwise explained some serpent are venomous they are armed with a formidable and deathdealing weapon certainly it is not for these that i ask your favor indeed if it were in my power to exterminate them all i would gladly free the earth of their presence but othersand these are far more numerousare not venomous and consequently are perfectly harmless unless they are large enough to hurt u by muscular force which is not rare in the hot country of the equator but never to be feared in our part of the world where the largest snake is not so strong a a mere child thus it is that some are much to be feared on account of their venom while others at least those of this region are not in the least dangerous but we are all too prone to lose sight of this difference in serpent the evil reputation of the one with venomous fang is fastened on all the others so that we abhor them all alike because we believe them all to be venomous in france we have only one venomous serpent the viper and all the others large a well a small are perfectly harmless and we will refer to them simply a snake in one of our former talk 7 i told you about the viper describing it form and coloring the structure of it venomous apparatus and the effect of it bite i here repeat the principal fact then related in order to give you now a connected account of our serpent a a class all serpent dart back and forth between their lip with extreme rapidity something that look like a black thread of great flexibility and ending in a fork many person believe this to be the reptile weapon the sting a they call it whereas in reality it is nothing but the tonguea quite inoffensive tongue which the creature us for catching insect to feed upon and also for expressing in it own peculiar fashion the passion that agitate it this last it doe by shooting the tongue swiftly in and out between the lip all serpent without exception have a tongue but in our country it is only the viper that posse the terrible apparatus for injecting venom this apparatus is composed first of two fang or long sharp teeth situated in the upper jaw unlike ordinary teeth these fang are not fixed firmly in their socket but can at the creature will stand up for attack or lie down in a groove of the gum and remain there a harmless a a stiletto in it sheath in this way the viper run no risk of wounding itself the fang are hollow and pierced near the point with a very small opening through which the venom is discharged into the wound they give finally at the base of each fang is a small pocket or sac filled with a venomous liquid it is to all appearance a perfectly harmless liquid odorless and tasteless so that you would take it for nothing but water when the viper strike with it fang the venom sac discharge a drop of it content into the tiny channel perforating the fang and the liquid is injected into the wound it is by mixing with the blood that the venom produce it terrifying effect i remember all that very well said jules and also what you said must be done to prevent the mixing of the venom with the blood in general that circulates through the body and i also told you that the viper haunt by preference warm rocky hill it lurks under stone and in underbrush in color it is brown or reddish with a dark zigzag stripe along the back and a row of spot on each side each spot fitting into one of the angle made by the zigzag stripe it stomach is slatecolor and it head rather triangular in shape being broader than the neck and running to a blunt point at the mouth the viper is timid by nature and attack man only in selfdefense it movement are abrupt irregular and sluggish what doe it live on jules inquired doe it eat nothing but little insect that it can catch with it tongue it chief food consists of larger prey which call for the use of it venomous weapon small fieldrats fieldmouse meadowmice mole sometimes frog and even toad are it usual victim the animal attacked by the reptile is first stung with the venomous fang whereupon it is immediately overcome with agony a soon a the prey is dead the viper twine it fold about the lifeless body squeeze it tightly and subject it to a sort of kneading process in order to make it smaller for the victim must be gulped down in one mouthful even if it exceeds the serpent itself in size this preparation finished the gullet open to it utmost width and the two jaw seeming almost to fly apart seize with their sharp teeth which point backward toward the throat the head of the mole or fieldmouse or whatever the small game may be a flow of saliva then stream over the body to make it slip down more readily but it is so large a mouthful that the viper manages to swallow it only by a violent effort the throat dilates and contract the jaw move alternately from right to left and from left to right to coax the unwieldy mass downward and so it is that this laborious swallowing is protracted sometimes for hour sometimes for a whole day indeed it not seldom occurs that the forward half of the prey is already undergoing digestion in the stomach while the hind quarter still stick in the throat or protrude from the mouth let u pas on to the common snake these have no venomous fang in the jaw their teeth are small and even and lacking in strength useful a an aid in holding the captured prey and helping in the swallowing of it which is a difficult a with the viper but incapable of inflicting a serious wound these creature too are extremely timid fleeing at the slightest alarm but if retreat is cut off they put on a bold front to impose on the enemy coiling themselves in a spiral erecting the head swaying this way and that hissing and trying to bite there is no need however to be afraid a scratch of no more importance than a pinprick would be the worst that could befall one you would suffer far greater injury by thrusting your hand into a bramblebush if it isnt any more dangerous than that jules declared boldly i shant mind taking up snake in my hand i do not tell you this to encourage you to capture these creature and make plaything of them on the contrary i wish you to leave them alone but i also desire to remove an unwarranted fear the fear of snake that is so prevalent in country district fear always an evil counselor never doe a good deed in prompting one to throw stone at a harmless creature found in a hole in the wall the passerby attack it with his stick if he see it crossing the road and the mower in the hayfield cut off it head with his scythe were they not listening to a foolish fear and yielding to an unreasonable dislike they would leave the poor thing in peace and no one would be the worse for it a snake not only are harmless but they render u excellent service by destroying numerous insect and small rodent such a meadowmice and fieldmouse from this point of view snake deserve protection and not the hatred that is commonly felt for them but objected louis they say snake can charm bird by their gaze and draw them into their open mouth by first overcoming them with their poisonous breath helpless the bird plunge headlong into the creature horrible gullet there is a grain of truth in what you say but far more untruth the result of popular superstition which deliberately credit the serpent with sorcery in the first place the breath of a serpent or of any reptile whatever ha nothing poisonous about it nothing magically attractive nothing supernatural you all have too much common sense to make it necessary for me to dwell on these ridiculous tale there remains only the belief that the bird is charmed by the reptile hard fixed gaze the marvel of this amount in reality to very little some of our snake are very fond of bird egg they climb tree search out the nest and eat the egg when the mother are not there to protect them more than one human nestrobber who thought he wa seizing a jay or a blackbird brood ha put his hand instead on the cold coiled body of a reptile in the bottom of the nest i have even known instance in which the plunderer seized with horror at this unexpected encounter fell backward from the treetop and did not come out of the adventure without broken bone a warning to others the larger snake do not content themselves with egg but devour the young bird a well even those that are outside the nest when they can catch them which fortunately is not easy imagine an innocent little bird surprised by a snake in the underbrush the poor little thing suddenly see before it a mouth horribly wide open and glittering eye regarding it steadily scared almost to death the bird loses it head and is powerless to take flight in vain it beat it wing cry plaintively and finally fall from the branch paralyzed and dying the monster lying in wait catch the poor thing in it mouth the power to charm that serpent are supposed to have is therefore in reality only the power so to terrify a bird that it can not fly we ourselves on being suddenly confronted by an appalling dangerdo we always retain the presence of mind necessary to face it are there not plenty of person that get bewildered lose their wit completely and make matter worse by acting foolishly the charm exerted by serpent all come down simply to that i am inclined to believe that a bird on being surprised by a snake usually is able to overcome the first feeling of terror and to take flight a soon a it see the reptile horrible gullet yawning to receive the expected prey and so the serpent attempt to paralyze it victim ha a chance to succeed only with very young and inexperienced bird what paralyzes with fright an ignorant young nestling hardly affect a bird that is master of itself what terrifies a child or a person of weak character make little impression on a man capable of keeping his head in time of danger acquire the habit child of keeping calm in time of danger or excitement and you will avoid many calamity and escape many peril just a the bird that doe not lose it head escape the snake lurking in ambush to catch it one of our common snake is the watersnake so called because it like damp place and frequents still water where it show itself a good swimmer in it pursuit of little fish water insect and tadpole it lay it egg usually in dunghill where they will be hatched out by the heat these egg are of an elongated oval shape with a soft shell resembling wet parchment in size they are about a large a a magpie egg they are joined together in a string by a semiliquid viscous substance on stirring a heap of dung country people often turn up with their fork these softshelled egg whose origin is unknown to them and from which to their great surprise come young serpent they declare them to be rooster egg unnatural egg magic egg that produce snake instead of chicken and it would be difficult to convince them that this is not true a for you my child if you ever happen to hear any one speak of egg laid by rooster in dunghill and producing serpent remember that they are simply the egg of the watersnake put no faith either in still another fable current in our village according to this all snake have a consuming desire to enter the mouth and then the body of any one sleeping on the cool grass to rid the patient of this inconvenient guest the serpent must be lured from it retreat by the smell of warm milk of course this is pure nonsense a no animal can wish to take refuge in the human stomach where it would be digested reduced to pap by the same process that digest our bread one often meet in hayfield or even in hay itself a small reptile differing from the snake in structure it is known a the slowworm or blindworm it head is small and merges into the body without narrowing into a neck furthermore the tail is blunt so that the two end of the body are of nearly the same shape and leave u for a moment in doubt a to which is the head and which the tail the slowworm is covered with very smooth and shiny scale the back is silvery yellow and marked from one end to the other by three black line which change a the worm grows older to a succession of dot and even disappear entirely at last the stomach is blackish on being disturbed the slowworm forcibly contract stiffens and becomes almost a rigid a a lizard tail many people believe that this little creature is venomous and even to touch it or meet it eye is thought to be very dangerous but it evil reputation is quite undeserved the slowworm is really the most harmless of reptile it doe not even offer to bite in it own defense but content itself with stiffening until it is a rigid a a wooden rod it life chiefly on beetle and earthworm now to conclude this brief account of snake viper excepted not one of our serpent is venomous none can harm u the bite of none is in the least dangerous snake do u no injury whatever on the contrary they help u by destroying a multitude of insect and small rodent let u then conquer an unreasonable horror and hatred and suffer these helper of ours to live in peace equal consideration should be shown to lizard those agile hunter of insect and even of small furbearing game such a rodent who doe not know the little gray lizard lover of sunny wall it lie in wait for fly darting it tongue in and out a if in play and it ransacks one hole after another in quest of insect it is the protector of wallfruit when on a fine spring day the sun shine warm on some wall or hillside the lizard may be seen stretched out comfortably on this wall or on the new grass covering the hillside it steep itself delightedly in the healthful warmth it show it pleasure by gentle undulation of it relaxed tail and by it shining eye and presently perhaps it dart like an arrow to seize some small prey or to find a spot still more to it liking far from fleeing at the approach of man it seems to regard him with friendliness but at the slightest alarming sound a the fall of a leaf it roll over fall and remains motionless for some moment a if stunned by the fall or else it dart away vanishes from sight reappears hide again then come forth once more turn and twist until the eye can hardly follow it fold itself over several time and finally retires to some shelter to recover from it fright a useful a it is graceful in form the little gray lizard life on fly cricket grasshopper earthworm and nearly all insect that prey upon our fruit and grain thus it would be much to our advantage if the specie were more widely scattered the greater our supply of gray lizard the faster should we see the enemy of our garden disappear the green lizard so common everywherein hedge on the skirt of wood in thicket having an undergrowth of wild grassattains a length of three decimeter the back show an elegant embroidery of green pearl set off with black and yellow dot this little creature is marvelously swift of foot darting into the midst of underbrush and dry leaf with a suddenness that always take one by surprise and cause at first a little start of fear when it is attacked by a dog it throw itself at the assailant snout and plant it teeth with such determination that it will let itself be carried along and even killed rather than relax it hold but it bite is not at all venomous it merely puncture the skin without leaving in the wound any kind of poison in captivity it becomes very tame very gentle and willingly let itself be handled it food consists chiefly of insect the olivegrowing district of france have another lizard larger stronger heavier and more squat in form than the common green lizard the people of provence call it the glassbead but scientist give it the name of ocellated lizard from the small black spot scattered like little eye ocellus in latin on the bluishgreen background of the creature back this lizard haunt dry hillside exposed to the full heat of the sun it bore for itself a deep hole in some sandy spot generally under the shelter of a projecting stone trusting to it formidable bite it is very bold not only doe it leap at dog snout but it will even attack man if it find itself too hardpressed this courage ha won for it a terrible reputation among country people who think it very dangerous more venomous than even the viper now uncle paul who know this lizard a well a he know the bottom of his own pocket who ha watched it movement for whole day in order to learn it habit who ha examined it teeth very carefully so a to be able to report with authority on it bite and who ha even let himself be bitten by it in order to leave no doubt on the subjectuncle paul i say declares that this dreaded lizard doe not deserve the reputation it bear it is not venomous in the least it bite hard it is true nipping the skin and even taking away a piece but without poisoning the wound in a word it is no more to be feared than the common green lizard it food consists of beetle grasshopper and small fieldrats and therefore despite the fear it inspires i have no hesitation in placing the ocellated lizard in the class of helper the batrachian i have kept until the last the ugliest and the least esteemed of our helper the toad with it must be classed the frog and the treetoad because of their close resemblance to it in form and still more because of the similar change all three undergo in developing from the egg to the fullgrown animal common language give the name of reptile from a latin word meaning to creep or crawl to the snake and the toad the lizard and the frog and all similar hairless animal having either no leg at all or very short one and crawling on the stomach science however make a difference it limit the name reptile to the snake the lizard and other animal having a scaly skin and hatching from the egg in the form they are to keep and it give the name batrachian from the greek batrachos a frog to the toad frog treetoad and some others which have a naked skin and whose first shape give place later to a different one reptile do not undergo a complete change batrachian do just a the butterfly is first a caterpillar quite different in structure it way of living and it diet from what it finally becomes in it perfect state so the toad the frog and the treetoad begin their existence a tadpole with none of the structure and habit they are finally to have tadpole or bighead that is the word to indicate the batrachian in it transitory state a very large head merging into a plump stomach that end abruptly in a flat tailsuch is the animal in the beginning it ha no limb no organ of locomotion unless it be the tail which whip the water to push the creature forward and serf a oar and rudder at the same time the toad tadpole is small and entirely black the frog tadpole is much larger silvery on the belly and grayish on the back all tadpole inhabit still water a pond or pool warmed by the sun but for toad tadpole even shallow puddle or wagonruts with a few inch of rain will suffice where they can gather in black row or stretch themselves flat on the stomach in the tepid mud at the water edge frog tadpole however thrive best in pond of some extent with various waterplants and sufficient depth for diving and swimming like fish tadpole breathe the air that is in water and like them also they die if kept out of water a short time thus they are real fish a far a breathing is concerned but in their final form batrachian breathe atmospheric air and die of suffocation in water they are land animal in that state and breathe like other land animal you have very often seen frog and toad in the water and no doubt you think they could live there indefinitely undeceive yourselves they go to the water only to lay their egg or to escape from some danger or to bathe in hot weather but they could not remain under water any length of time without dying they have to come up at interval to breathe which they do by getting at least the nostril out here we have a difference between the tadpole and the fullgrown batrachian between the larva so to speak and the creature at it maturity the tadpole life in water and perishes in the air whereas the frog that come from it life in the air and perishes in water and there is a still further difference the tadpole life exclusively on vegetable matter it mouth is equipped with a sort of small horny beak to browse the foliage of waterplants and in it big belly it ha a very long intestine coiled about several time so a to prolong the passage of the food through the body and thus make sure that all the juice it may contain are extracted the mature batrachian exchange this horny beak for real jaw furnished with irregularity that serve a teeth it life solely on an animal diet especially on insect and it intestine is short because the food it eats is easy of digestion and readily yield what nourishment it contains to turn a tadpole into a frog or a toad it is not enough to change it respiratory and digestive organ new organ form organ of which there wa not the least sign when the creature wa hatched while still others disappear without leaving any trace the tadpole is born absolutely without leg after a while the hind leg appear later come the fore leg and still later the tail shrink and vanishes i remember seeing tadpole said jules some with two leg some with four but every one of them had a tail when the tail ha disappeared the animal is no longer a tadpole but a young toad or frog doe the tail come off itself or doe the animal pull it off emile inquired with eager interest neither the one nor the other the tail is too valuable when the change take place to be thrown away in that reckless fashion it contains a store of material suitable for making something else in the bodily organism when the leg begin to put forth when the organ of digestion and those of respiration begin to take a new form these new creation these transformation require material with which to build fleshy substance is needed for the upbuilding of the body just a brick and mortar are needed for the construction of the house of course the tadpole eats to make flesh and to provide a reserve for the work of transformation but this method of accumulation is slow and therefore to save time the organ useless to the future animal are destroyed bit by bit and their material is used in the construction of new part it is thus that the tail disappears the blood circulating through it gradually eats it away dissolve it a we might say at the proper time and carry elsewhere the fluid substance which turned again into flesh help to form the leg or other part of the remodeled organism what a deal of economy in getting rid of a tadpole tail exclaimed emile not a particle of it even if no bigger than a pin head must be thrown away for it might be used to make the little toe on one of the foot yes my boy a wonderful economy an economy careful of every atom of matter in order that life the divine worker may not fail to have at it disposal undiminished by waste the resource committed to it keeping by the creator for work that are unceasingly being destroyed and then restored on a new plan i should add here that certain batrachian keep the tail a long a they live to this class belong the salamander one specie of which the terrestrial or land salamander is extremely ugly in form it is halfway between a toad and a lizard and it color is black with large brightyellow spot it is from one to two decimeter long it haunt damp place near spring and eats insect and earthworm despite it repulsive appearance it is perfectly harmless the tadpole of the salamander breathes through fine tuftlike appendage which spread out in the water on each side of the neck these tuft are called gill and they correspond to the fish breathing organ or gill which are likewise situated on each side of the neck under the tiny flap commonly called the ear tadpole of the frog and the toad have for the first few day fringed gill floating out freely but in a short time they are drawn in under the skin and become invisible like the gill of fish frog have a slender form not devoid of a certain grace their hind leg are very long and powerful being especially good at jumping the frog customary mode of progress first gathering itself together the animal suddenly relaxes like a spring and throw itself forward by a vigorous thrust of the thigh the hind toe are very markedly webbed in other word they are united by a membrane a are the toe of swimming bird the duck in particular this arrangement of the toe so a to form a broad paddle or oar together with the suppleness of the hind leg which are alternately drawn up against the side and then forcibly extended make the frog an expert swimmer the common or green frog is spotted with black on a green background and it ha three yellowish stripe on the back the belly also being yellow it abounds on the bank of all still water and to it we owe the noisy croaking that come from every ditch on a summer evening the red frog is spotted with black on a reddish background and is easily recognizable by the black stripe running from the eye over the ear it like cool place such a damp meadow and field and underbrush it is le fond of the water than the one just named and it croak much le both live on live prey a for example aquatic larvæ worm fly and other insect and snail and they never touch vegetable matter therefore they are good helper in our garden treetoadsor le correctly treefrogsdiffer from ordinary frog in having viscous cushion at the end of their toe which enable them to climb tree where they hunt insect they stay all summer in the foliage and go to the water only to lay their egg their cry which gain force from a sort of pocket that show plainly under the throat is very loud and raucous the treetoad that we have around here the common treetoad is of a beautiful delicate green hue on the back and yellowishwhite on the belly the toad what shall i say in defense of that poor creature the toad whose very name is enough to excite disgust it is really loathed by all it seems to u the ugliest and most disgusting of animal what ha it done poor thing to deserve the dislike every one feel for it it is ugly the plaintiff asserts it flabby form is a shapeless lump thrown together a if in careless haste and it flattened dirtcolored back is strewn with livid wart it leg too short for symmetry or for effectual service are unable to lift out of the mud it swollen stomach which drag on the ground it big head merges into a hideous mouth and heavy eyelid open to show large and prominent eye which stare stupidly if some danger threatens it puff itself up forming under it skin an aircushion which resists blow with it flabby elasticity it is venomous the plaintiff further declares squatting in the mire at the bottom of some dark hole it absorbs the unwholesome humor of the slime for use in filling the wart on it back with a milky venom which ooze out and moistens the entire body in time of peril it also squirt into the eye of any one who attack it a liquid it urine which burn and sting it infects the atmosphere with it foul breath from it gullet drip a fluid that poison the grass and fruit over which the animal pass so that it track is a fatal a it appearance is loathsome in a word the toad is ugly and venomous then war without mercy on the hideous creature that infects earth air water and by it very appearance disgust the beholder there you have the charge against the toad now what shall i say in my turn in defense of the poor creature i shall tell the truth the simple truth and the charge made against it will be reduced to nothing a to the ugliness of the toad i will not say a word all are welcome to their own opinion on that subject i only ask you to recall our talk about bat i dont think the toad so horribly ugly jules ventured to assert it goldenyellow eye are full of fire it voice is sweet almost flutelike while the frog croak is anything but musical i admit that the toad bloated body is not graceful but after all it ha some good point little toad hopping about among the reed at the edge of the pond said emile are pretty to look at and they make me laugh when they tumble heel over head every time they jump i have taken them up in my hand but i wouldnt touch big toad i am afraid of them i wouldnt either jules agreed for fear of their venom ah the venom that is the serious side of the question and not the creature ugliness which is open to discussion the toad ha the beauty appropriate to it the beauty of a toad and it can not have any other without ceasing to be what it is on being molested toad perspire through the wart that cover their skin a thick and viscous fluid that look somewhat like milk this secretion ha a nauseous burning taste and is unbearably bitter some one then ha tasted the milky sweat that ooze from the toad wart asked jules yes scientist have tasted it in order to tell u the truth about it just a others have done with the viper venom we must respect highly these courageous investigator who are willing to make any sacrifice if only they may add to our knowledge and relieve our suffering the toad sweat this milky liquid when tormented is that the way it defends itself jules further inquired it hope to defend itself by the horrid odor of it sweat and by it intolerably bitter taste but this sweat is put to no further use the animal would be truly dangerous if it could inject it sweat into our blood a the viper injects it venom through it fang into the wound already made by them i will now relate a few experiment made by the scientist i just referred to a drop of the toad milky fluid is introduced with a pointed steel instrument into the flesh of a little bird in a few minute the bird stagger a if intoxicated shuts it eye gasp and fall dead really and truly dead asked emile really and truly dead his uncle replied a dog is treated in the same manner but with a stronger dose in le than an hour the animal dy in a frightful frenzy then this white sweat of the toad must be a perfectly horrible venom jules remarked traveler tell u that certain south american indian tribe poison the tip of their arrow with this venom first they impale alive on a long stick a number of these animal and then put them near the fire to make their wart sweat the fluid that ooze out is collected in a large leaf and into this fluid the savage dip their arrowhead a wound from which is then likely to prove fatal isnt it the truth then asked jules that toad are venomous yes and no applied in any way but by injection the toad sweat is harmless to act a venom it must mix with the blood through a wound but i will not repeat what i have already told you about the viper venom the toad is powerless to make the slightest wound in our flesh and therefore it is absolutely impossible for it to harm u it posse a poison without being able to make any use of it except to bedew it own body by perspiring thus repelling it enemy by the horrid smell and taste of this sweat you can handle a toad without any sort of risk if you wish to wash your hand immediately afterward if they have become moistened by the contact and there will be no further trouble unless the foolish fancy should seize you to collect a little of the venomous liquid on the point of a penknife and then prick yourself with the knife till you drew blood i can assure you positively that the toad would cause you no injury whatever that is plain enough jules admitted for the toad ha no mean of making a wound to receive the venom from it wart but they tell of other kind of venom such a urine thrown to a distance and drivel running from the mouth no drivel run from the toad mouth nor is there any truth in the animal poisoning fruit and grass with it saliva that is pure calumny invented to blacken the detested animal and the urine the toad when molested discharge it urine a a mean of defense but not to any distance you would have to hold your face close to the animal to receive the discharge in the eye if that should happen to some careless person a temporary redness of the eye would be the utmost result but no one would think of putting his face so close to the animal and so there is no cause for alarm on that score what about the creature terrible breath wa juless next inquiry another calumny on a par with that about the saliva it breath is no more harmful than any other animal so there is absolutely nothing left of the charge brought against the toad the poison it sweat in moment of danger to drive away it enemy can not injure a venom injures because the animal ha no mean of injecting it into a wound and mixing it with the blood a venom must be mixed to take effect the discharge of it urine fall too short to be dangerous and even if it should reach it mark it effect would be so slight that it is not worth considering doe any one give a thought to the hedgehog urine when that animal spray itself with this liquid on being molested the toad similar mode of defense is no more to be feared the other complaint such a the swelling of one hand after touching the animal air poisoned by it breath fruit and vegetable infected by the saliva and the creature track all come from people prejudice their imagination which ha given the poor batrachian a bad reputation the toad is harmless but that is not enough to entitle it to our consideration it is also a very useful helper a devourer of beetle slug larvævermin of every description in short after spending the day under a cool stone or in some dark hole it leaf it retreat at nightfall to make it round hunching itself along on it big belly here is a slug making such haste a it can toward the lettuce bed there a cricket chirping at the mouth of it hole and there again a junebug laying it egg in the ground very softly the toad approach and in three mouthful gobble them all up with a gurgle of satisfaction ah those tasted good and now for some more it continues on it way and by the time it ha finished it round at daybreak you may imagine what a multitude of worm and other small prey the glutton ha stowed away in it capacious stomach and yet this useful creature is stoned to death because it is ugly my child never commit any such act of cruelty at once foolish and harmful do not stone the toad for you would thereby deprive the field and garden of a vigilant guardian let it go it way in peace and it will destroy so many insect that you will in the end find it le ugly than you had thought so well known is the toad usefulness that in england the animal is an article of commerce toad are bought in the market at so much a head carried home carefully so a not to come to any harm and then allowed the freedom of the garden or placed in a hothouse a crystal palace perhaps where wonderful plant are grown the toad business is to lie in wait for beetle slug and other destroyer that might nibble the valuable plant and it doe it duty with zeal what a change of fortune for the maligned creature when it find itself living in a warm atmosphere and surrounded by the most splendid flower procured at great expense from all part of the world and now exhaling the most fragrant odor a a finishing touch to the honor done the poor thing in it floral palace of glass there is offered the tribute of poetry that flower of the human imagination and invention listen to this a wretched toad with head split open and one eye gouged out by some cruel hand wa painfully dragging itself along through the mud of a public highway when four small boy chanced to spy it a they were passing they spied the toad and one and all sent up a gleeful shout come on come on let kill the ugly lout but first well have some fun they laughed their fill a boy will laugh hardhearted when they kill they pricked and goaded with a pointed stick devising each in turn some cruel trick flushed with their sport egged on by passersby while for the martyred toad none gave a sigh poor ugly thing but nature made it so for this alone it blood wa caused to flow it tried to flee one foot wa severed quite which gave the heartless band renewed delight it gougedout eye hung down halfblind it sought some sheltering reed it effort came to naught it mangled form had been you would have sworn through some machine to be so rent and torn and oh to think that heart can be so base a to wish ill to one in such sad case and to so great a load of suffering sore to undertake to add one torment more wellnigh exhausted now hope almost gone the halfdismembered creature still toiled on een death itself would not for pity sake so hideous a thing consent to take or thus it seemed and so with antic rude the toad tormentor still their sport pursued attempt to snare it next were made in vain it dodged and sought a rut half filled with rain and by it muddy bath somewhat restored withstood the missile that upon it poured ah what a sight wa there the beauty fresh of childhood and it joy in bleeding flesh such sport a theirs there surely neer had been come on they called come john come benjamin and bring a stone a big one and well see if master toad is quite a smart a we accordingly a massive stone wa found of ponderous weight unwieldy large and round but cheerfully the lad their muscle strained with end so laudable to be attained just then by curious chance there passed that way an overloaded heavyrumbling dray an aged donkey deaf halfstarved and lame wa harnessed to the cartthe more the shame and on it back a pannier also bore a long day march behind and home before the patient beast trudged on with labored breath though each step more seemed like to be it death it toilworn frame wa so exceeding thin you would have said twas naught but bone and skin it bore full many mark of cruel blow and in it eye one read the tale of those that suffer hardship without hope meanwhile it master heaped upon it curse vile nor spared the cudgel but the road wa deep in mire that clogged the wheel the hill were steep creaking and groaning in lugubrious tone the dray thus pulled by thing of skin and bone moved slowly forward till at length the road descended sharply and thus eased the load but this now crowded on the nighspent beast with force sufficient so it seemed at least to hurl him headlong and yet strange to tell the donkey paused unheeding blow that fell from wrathful hand the boy broke off their play content to yield the donkey right of way stand off they cried let go there dick and bob let go the stone the cart will do our job with much more sport for u so stand aside all stood alert to see what should betide their wretched victim but far otherwise the thing fell out before their wondering eye than they had thought the donkey bruised and lame at sight of woe that put his own to shame spared not himself but gathered all his strength and held the loaded cart until at length although remonstrant blow rained on his back he turned the dray from out the beaten track the grinding wheel diverted harmless pas and tortured toad is saved by tortured as the driver crack his whip pull at the rein and now the dray once more the road regains at that one of the group engaged in play the very one who tell you this today let fall the stone hed been about to cast just a the laden wain came rumbling past and a he dropped it lo in accent clear a mandate from on high fell on his ear a mandate that wa quickly understood for it wa brief these simple word be good 8 in closing i repeat with the great poet be good be good if you wish god to love you be good that you may grow up to be noblehearted men be good to one another helping one another be good to the animal that give u their fleece their strength and their life and those that protect the fruit of the earth for u by keeping vigilant guard over them be kind to them all even to the humblest among them the toad which serf u uncomplainingly and asks in return no pay but a pitying glance instinct jules and emile had put a caterpillar into a glass and brought it to their uncle who made it the subject of a little talk to his young hearer examine the creature closely said he it skin is delicate so delicate that even a light touch hurt it but here on the head at the point called the skull it ha the hardness of horn forming a sort of cap or helmet which can without injury endure friction with the hard texture of wood the head is the part of the creature that open the way and it is therefore protected by armor while the rest of the body a it follows the head doe not need this casing of horn i understand said emile the creature work it way along by scratching and tunneling with it foot no my boy the foot are not used for boring through wood the caterpillar ha eight pair the first three pair or those nearest the head have quite a different shape from the others they are slender and pointed and it is they that in the change that take place later become the butterfly leg though in doing so they grow much longer and take another shape hence they are called the true leg the next four pair are placed toward the middle of the body and the last pair is at the very end these five pair bear the name of false leg because they completely disappear when the caterpillar give place to the butterfly or moth they are short and wide and are furnished beneath with numerous little hook by which the caterpillar cling to the wall of it abode the stiff hair covering the body are also used for locomotion the caterpillar wriggling and squirming in it tunnel somewhat a doe the chimneysweep in helping himself with knee and back a he make his way up the inside of a chimney then what doe the caterpillar use for boring through the wood asked jules the tool for chipping away the wood consists of two curved fang or teeth almost black one on each side of the mouth which open and shut like a pair of cutting nipper they are called mandible and are in reality jaw or more properly teeth which instead of meeting in a vertical plane a do ours come together horizontally or sidewise for precision of movement these mandible are superior to our best cutting nipper and for hardness they are almost equal to steel they seize the wood bit by bit patiently and untiringly they cut saw tear away a little at a time and so bore a tunnel just large enough for the caterpillar to pas through and what becomes of the wooddust jules further inquired i should think it would block the way the passage being so narrow the wooddust pass through the creature body the caterpillar eats it and after digestion ha taken from it the very small amount of nourishment it contains it is ejected behind molded into tiny pellet digestion in a caterpillar is soon accomplished just think of it wood is an extremely meager fare and so the worm must keep on eating it way forward cutting gnawing digesting to acquire the fatness necessary for the coming change the creature must have a goodsized peartree limb or lilac trunk to work on the wormhole dust left behind by the boring worm sometimes betrays the insect to it enemy whenever you see any of this dust left by digestion coming out at some little orifice in the bark of a peartree appletree or other tree you may know the borer is at work and the branch where he is at work should be cut off immediately to prevent more serious harm if the caterpillar ha not gone too far a pointed iron wire may be thrust into the opening and an attempt made to kill the creature in it hole but a the passage is very winding this method is by no mean certain of success couldnt the wire be pushed in through another opening queried jules but my boy you dont suppose the caterpillar is so simple a to make window here and there in it dwelling and so make it easy for it foe of which it ha many besides man to attack it if it should take a fancy let u say to go out and get a little fresh air some fine day a sparrow might spy it and carry it off a a choice titbit for it brood under the roof tile all these danger it know or rather it guess them vaguely for every creature even to the smallest worm know how to protect itself and preserve it specie unquestionably it lack the reasoning faculty which belongs only to man but it none the le act a if it reasoned out it own interest with an accuracy that astounds the thoughtful observer a a matter of fact my dear child another ha already reasoned for it and that other is the universal reason in and by whom all live it is god the father of men and also the father of lilac and of the caterpillar that gnaw them the creature know then without ever having learned it is master of it art without having been taught and at the very first trial with no experience to rely on it doe admirably the thing it wa intended to do this gift bestowed at birth this unfailing inspiration that guide it in it work is called instinct in it butterfly state the leopardmoth take very little food at the most a few drop of honey from the opening flower it proboscis so slender and so delicate is fitted to get this food now that it no longer ha it strong mandible how can the moth imagine that wood is eatable is it possible that it remembers what it liked a a caterpillar who can say moreover how can the moth tell what tree have wood suitable for the larvæ when we ourselves must have a certain degree of education in order to know the commonest variety the moth with no previous education never mistake a planetree for a peartree a boxtree for a lilac an oak for an elm thus the egg are always laid on the right sort of tree never on any other where man might make a mistake the insect never errs the young larva come out of the egg what doe the poor little thing know from experience of the hard trade it is to follow nothing absolutely nothing no matter a soon a it is born it attack the wood it rest upon and hollow out a shelter for itself with the least possible delay this most urgent business being attended to it now leisurely gnaws it way ahead nibbling a little here and a little there and shaping it course according to the quality of the wood the passage lengthens increasing in diameter a the creature grows and sometimes ascending sometimes descending sometimes running horizontally quite through the trunk or branch the mass of the wood may be attacked with little system and without economy for the larva is assured of food enough in any event one precaution however it invariably take it never bore through the bark for fear of betraying it presence to hostile eye but how doe the larva working in total darkness know when it is getting near the bark and must turn back what give it the fear it ha of showing itself what make it so careful to remain in the heart of the wood and thus avoid the vigilant sparrow it ha never seen it is instinct the inspiration that protects all animalkind in the fierce battle of life the grainweevil uncle paul had sent old jacques to town to buy the drug they were going to apply to simon wheat meanwhile he took occasion to tell his young hearer about the wheatdevourer that wa to have the benefit of the drug the handful of grain left by simon wa in a plate on the table the little weevil were running about in frantic endeavor to escape while emile with a straw wa pushing them back into the middle of the plate where they cowered among the kernel of wheat louis and jules were also there all attention to what wa going on this ravager of our granary began uncle paul is called the grainweevil or in latin calandra it belongs to the order of coleoptera or beetle it defensive armor is a hard brown casing finely engraved it ha no membranous wing under the elytron or wing sheath hence it is unable to fly but it run fast enough and it cling to object with a firm grip you see how busy emile is kept with his straw in preventing the prisoner escape the grainweevil is about four millimeter long it body is of a uniform blackish brown and it head end in a long snout a kind of slender trumpet the corselet or thorax is long marked with fine prick or dot and the wing sheath are delicately furrowed the insect most striking characteristic is it long trumpetshaped snout it seems to me said jules i have seen other beetle and rather large one too with the head ending in a trumpet like that ive found them on hazel added louis and they had a long slender beak that would make you think the insect wa smoking a long pipe the trumpet beetle form a numerous class and they are all weevil but their mode of life varies for the different specie some attack fruittrees and grapevine we will speak of them one of these day with it pointed snout the grainweevil make a tiny hole in a kernel of wheat and in this it lay an egg which it make fast by mean of a sticky liquid from it own body then it pass immediately to other kernel and treat them in the same way until it store of egg is exhausted and all this is done with such delicate nicety that the sharpest eye would fail to detect any trace of these mischievous germ in the kernel but a weevil know very well when a kernel ha already received an egg from whatever source and never doe it commit the blunder of laying a second one there for the grain of wheat is too small for more than one eater to each kernel it larva to each larva it kernel and no more soon the egg hatch the tiny worm puncture the envelop of the grain and through the almost invisible opening make it way into the mealy substance within there it is at home in perfect quiet peacefully devoted to the pleasure of feasting for it own exclusive use a grain of wheat a whole grain of wheat thus it grows big and fat in five or six week the flour is all eaten up but the bran remains for the clever larva is careful not to make a hole in it it will need it to serve a a cradle during the coming change the gnawed kernel appears quite whole when a a matter of fact it is hollow and lodge a weevil in this hidingplace the larva turn into a nymph and the latter into a perfect insect then the fully developed weevil tear open the bran covering and leaf it home to explore the pile of wheat select certain ungnawed grain and lay it egg in them egg that will in time produce a new population of ravagers here uncle paul picked out a few grain one by one and submitted them to his hearer scrutiny what do you see that is at all unusual in those grain he asked look at them well i have looked and looked emile replied after a little and i dont see anything i dont see anything either said jules nor i added louis those grain boy have no flour in them despite their fair outside appearance the weevil ha emptied them but how can you tell so easily asked jules a kernel inhabited by the grainweevil yield to the pressure of a finger and is also lighter in weight than one that is sound from appearance alone one can not tell infested kernel from uninjured one a the outside look the same in both case thus without extreme vigilance the inroad of the weevil pas unperceived until the developed insect show themselves and then the evil is beyond remedy didnt simon think he had a fine lot of wheat when there wa hardly anything but the bran left a very simple experiment suffices to prove the condition of the wheat throw a handful of it into water and all the sound kernel will sink to the bottom all the unsound one float on the surface we will perform this experiment with the wheat on the plate if jules will go to the spring and bring a glass of water the water wa brought and uncle paul threw the wheat into it a few grain sank many floated these latter were opened with the point of a pin and in some wa found a little soft white worm without leg but furnished with strong mandible it wa the larva of the grainweevil in others there wa a white nymph and in a few wa the perfect insect all ready to leave it snug abode to judge by the number of grain that floated jules remarked simon pile of wheat even if it is not a very big one must contain million of weevil it must have taken a lot of the creature to produce such an immense family mustnt it not so many a you might think how many egg do you suppose one weevil lay a dozen perhaps ah how far out you are in your reckoning in the course of one season a weevil lay from eight to ten thousand egg from which spring a many larvæ each gnawing a grain a liter measure 9 contains on an average ten thousand grain of wheat to feed the family of one weevil therefore nearly a liter of wheat is needed suppose there are a thousand pair of these insect in a granary that would be enough to destroy ten hectoliter of wheat rye barley or oat for they attack all kind of grain impartially the common caterpillar i remember said jules one sunday last winterit wa some time in december or january i thinkthe mayor had just posted a notice on the door of the town hall and the people were reading it a they came from church the notice wa something about caterpillar and the mayor had ordered their nest to be destroyed yes rejoined uncle paul the mayor had in mind luckily for u the caterpillar law what is there a law about caterpillar with a fine for disobeying it yes my boy there is a law about caterpillar and i thank the legislature that had the wisdom to pas it god grant it may become a more general statute and include a greater number of our insect enemy the junebug especially and that it may be strictly enforced but that would put people out to have to leave their business and go and hunt for caterpillarnests and burn them at least thats what oneeyed john said when he read the mayor notice leave their business you say is it leaving one business to go and save the crop when they are threatened law my young friend are rule made for the general good and we should all obey them scrupulously if there are any narrowminded objector or stupid grumblersany oneeyed john in shortthat choose to take offense so much the worse for them they will have to obey in any event for the common interest is not to be compromised by the foolishness of a few the mayor notice had especial reference to a caterpillar whose ravage are in some season truly calamitous so abundant is this caterpillar in central and northern france that it is called briefly the common caterpillar it is encountered everywhere on fruittrees and forest tree in garden walk and on plant and hedge and even on the bark of tree sometimes in countless legion it is dark brown in color with six row of little tubercle or pimple of the same hue each bearing a tuft of long red hair the ringlike segment to which is attached the last pair of false leg and also the following segment have each a plump red nipple which can at the caterpillar pleasure recede under the skin or stand out prominently the butterfly developing from this caterpillar is pure white except on the abdomen which is brown furthermore the female ha a thick tuft of red hair at the end of the abdomen it purpose is shown when the egg are laid after these are deposited to the number of three or four hundred the butterfly rub off the hair and place it over the egg the laying take place in july and the egg deposited in a little heap on a leaf are rose red but if they are on a leaf objected emile they must fall from the tree when the leaf fall and then the wind might blow them away the butterfly that lay it egg on a leaf know very well what it is about on the other hand those butterfly that lay egg that are to go through the winter and hatch in the spring are very careful not to entrust their egg to a leaf which will soon fall to the ground they make their egg fast to the bark but whence do they get their knowledge of the future who told them the leaf would fall and therefore would be insecure restingplaces for the egg they do not learn this by experience for they have never seen the autumnal shedding of leaf having been born when the foliage is already well advanced for their nourishment and laying their egg and dying while it is still on the tree if then experience can not account for it we must ascribe the insect mysterious foreknowledge to the incomprehensible inspiration of instinct which see the invisible and know the unknown because there is a sovereign intelligence that know all and order all our common caterpillar likewise is led by instinct when it lay it egg on a leaf for long before the fall of that leaf they will hatch in the last fortnight of july a cunning rascal that caterpillar said emile it know the order of the season a if it had the almanac by heart i havent told you all another motive act in determining the butterfly course in laying it egg on a leaf the insect place them where the young caterpillar are sure to find food close at hand when they come out of the egg so that they will not have to go running about over the branch a dangerous thing at their tender age all anxiety a to food supply is thus removed at the outset and this assurance against famine is so much to the good in this world of chance and uncertainty whether for men or caterpillar if the butterfly reasoned it all out said jules it couldnt do any better perhaps not so well my child are there not plenty of people ala that show far le foresight the butterfly leaf to it young a leaf a a heritage a leaf to eat whereas the spendthrift the idler leaf to his family nothing but poverty and suffering he ha not even the wisdom of an insect caterpillar at table in the latter part of july the egg hatch and through the covering of down appear here and there little head pushing aside the fluff that is in their way the first caterpillar hatched out crawl forward and begin to browse on the upper surface of the leaf grazing it lightly and without eating through to the under surface or touching the vein it feed only on the pulpy matter forming most of the leaf thickness a the hatching continues another little caterpillar advance and take it place beside the first then a third a fourth and so on until the whole width of the leaf is occupied in this way is formed the first row of browsing caterpillar all with head in a straight line and leaving in front a certain unoccupied space the next caterpillar to emerge from under the matting of down begin a second row by taking it station at the tail of one of the preceding one after which others place themselves at the right and left this row completed a third is formed in the same manner and then others so that in a short time the entire surface of the leaf except the forward end is covered with row of eater if one leaf is not enough for the whole brood the later comer establish themselves in like order on neighboring leaf there they are then all at table the strictest discipline prevails in this leafy dininghall each caterpillar gnaws what is directly under it mandible without turning to right or left a that would take from it neighbor share without advancing ahead of it own line a that would mean using the supply of the future and without falling behind a that would throw the rear rank into confusion under these condition a few mouthful and no more fall to each caterpillar that is very little for a larva appetite it must have more but how obtain it scatter abroad on other leaf haphazard undoubtedly there is plenty of room for all on the tree but that would be highly imprudent they must keep together for union is the strength of the weak they must keep together to be able to offer some sort of formidable appearance to their enemy it would be equally objectionable for each to be a law to itself and gnaw where it chose on the same leaf the resulting confusion would cause waste and also it would be very difficult for each to get it proper share some stuffing themselves and others near by dying of hunger in such absence of law and order they would come to blow and fight desperately for a footing on the leaf so that civil war would soon thin their rank for there is no worse counselor in such emergency than the stomach order is the only solution of their problem order which safeguard human a well a insect community what do they do then asked jules we are coming to that each caterpillar a i said gnaws only the spot directly within reach in this way there is left unbrowsed first the part covered by each body and then the forward part of the leaf which is still unoccupied the first row of caterpillar advance one step and find a second ration in the part thus reached but at the same time it uncovers in the rear a crosswise strip one step wide which the second row now advance to feed upon while in it turn it leaf a similar strip free for the third row and so on one step forward for the whole troop put each row in possession of the strip left uncovered by the preceding row a for the first row it feed little by little on the forward part of the leaf designedly left unoccupied in the beginning when step by step the very end of the leaf is reached each caterpillar ha gnawed a strip a long and a wide a it own body by that time the first meal is finished you see that with order and economy a hundred and more caterpillar all have a place in the dininghall on the surface of the leaf and all have a nearly equal ration a if these had been allotted by weight and measure animal with their instinct are wonderful creature uncle observed jules every day brings some fresh surprise it is not the creature itself that is to be wondered at my dear child the marvel it accomplishes are not the fruit of it reflection a grub just out of the egg can have no idea on method economy coöperation when in order to acquire these idea man need the full maturity of his reason our tribute of admiration should be paid to the infinite wisdom which governs the world and lead a brood of caterpillar browsing the surface of a leaf their first hunger appeased the caterpillar construct a shelter from rain and the heat of the sun on it gnawed side the leaf is dryer than on the other and consequently ha of itself taken a kind of concave shape by curling up which make it serve excellently for the floor and wall of the new abode a for the ceiling that is to be of silk from one raised edge of the leaf to the other the caterpillar stretch thread to strengthen their shelter and serve a framework for the roof and finally they weave a fabric on this network of thread thus is erected a tent under which the caterpillar take refuge for the night after roaming over the foliage most of the day feeding sometimes on one leaf sometimes on another thither also they retire when the heat is excessive or the weather threatening it is a shelter hastily constructed and not of enduring quality besides being too small to hold them all so other tent are made of other gnawed leaf and the caterpillar live for a while divided into small family but with the first rainstorm of autumn in september or october a large building is constructed for housing the whole colony through the winter it is a bulky mass of dry leaf and white silk with no definite shape the inside is divided with silk partition into numerous apartment to which there is access through hole that pierce systematically the several partition each enclosure thus ha it door which without being directly opposite each other yet provide free circulation in short this common nest though made of extremely fine silk is substantial enough to be proof against wind and weather for the caterpillar use many web placed one over another and each containing a great number of thread with the coming of the first cold weather all shut themselves up the door are barricaded with silk and everything is made snug for the winter now let the wind blow and the snow fall curled up together and snuggling against one another the caterpillar sleep the deep sleep produced by the cold lying torpid in their house of silk until the warmth of opening spring awakens them and sends them forth to browse on the growing leaf and dont they eat anything all winter asked emile all winter a well a a part of the autumn and spring they take no food whatever their fast last six month and it is an absolute fast that must leave them with very empty stomach they must be awfully hungry when they wake up so hungry that they make a dash for the tender young leaf and opening flower and in le than no time strip an orchard bare if the nest are very numerous whole forest are browsed to the last leaf and then to prevent these ravage the mayor notice is heeded some time in the winter these terrible bag of dry leaf and silk are detached from the tree hedge and bush and the nest with their occupant are burned in spring it would be too late the caterpillar would all have left their quarter enemy of the grapevine one morning jules wa sent to the mill to give notice that his uncle wheat wa ready to be ground after he had left the village his road ran along beside a vineyard that showed sign of neglect weed and thistle springing up unchecked nevertheless the vine were pleasing to the eye in the spring freshness of their tender green shoot with their cluster of blossom still in the bud and their delicate tendril reaching out for something to cling to here and there leaf of faded and ragged appearance with others that were dried up and shriveled took away somewhat from the general effect but they were not very numerous and jules failed to notice them at first afterward for the last half of the way along the vineyard these withered leaf became so abundant that the young vine shoot looked a if they had been swept by a fire some ravager is at work here said the boy to himself for his eye were daily becoming more keenly observant let look into this a little the vine were pitiful to behold their young shoot showing more and more toward the growing end where the grape cluster were forming dried and crumpled leaf some of these being rolled up like cigar under closer scrutiny there wa often to be seen an insect with a long beak a weevil of a brilliant metallic green color without question this beautiful weevil wa the cause of the mischief insect and cigar especially the former sparkling creature in the bright light of the sun were soon collected by jules a specimen to take home just then oneeyed john the owner of the vineyard came along what are you doing there he demanded catching a few of these insect that are ruining your vine the boy replied let me see them here they are and you say they are ruining my vine i think so i have just seen some of them making these cigar oh bosh you silly do you think they would take the trouble to make cigar out of leaf they dont smoke it the moon that ha burned my vine the moon and so satisfied with his explanation oneeyed john turned on his heel and went off whistling a tune but he would stop whistling when three year later he had to pull up those vine exhausted a they were by the cigarrollers nevertheless he would not take back what he had said the moon had caused all the mischief returning from the mill jules picked up louis on the way and brought him back to share in the benefit of what uncle paul might have to say concerning the specimen jules had collected the insect found on the vine said he after examining one of the brilliant creature is a weevil you all remember that this name is given to various beetle with a head tapering into a sort of trumpet this one is the rhynchites a entomologist call it or the vinegrub a it is known to vinegrowers it is of a magnificent lustrous green on the back and underneath it shine like gold some darkblue one are also found but they are more rare the male ha on each side of the thorax a little pointed protuberance directed forward the larva is a small white legless worm that begin life in a roll made by the mother with a vine leaf in the month of may she begin operation by cutting the stem of the leaf threequarters through to arrest the flow of sap so that the leaf may wither and be the easier to roll then the weevil roll it up and lay three or four egg in it fold when in the process of drying the leaf ha assumed the color of tobacco you would take it for a cigar hanging from the vine the young larvæ soon abandon this first shelter let themselves fall and burrow into the ground where they finish developing the vinegrub sap the vigor of the vine by destroying it leaf and therefore the cigarlike roll should be picked off and burned in may or june in this way the infant insect are destroyed in the cradle and much future damage is prevented along with the shiny green weevil that roll vine leaf into cigar i found this other insect jules announced displaying the creature that is not a weevil a you can see from the shape of it head which ha no tapering beak it wing sheath are chestnut red the rest of the body being black it is known a the eumolpus or more commonly the vinefretter or in our language the scrivener because in gnawing the surface of the vine leaf it trace fine line that look somewhat like intricate handwriting it attack in the same way the stem of grape leaf and of grape cluster the young shoot of the vine and the grape themselves if the insect are numerous all these incision and laceration cause the vine to wither away and produce but little fruit and that of poor quality the larvæ of the vinefretter live in the ground and to destroy them the soil thus infested is turned over in the winter a exposure to the cold kill the grub when the insect are fully developed it is exceedingly difficult to rid the vine of them at the slightest alarm the little creature busy with it destructive writing on the leaf draw it leg up under it belly and let itself drop to the ground where it can not be easily seen because of it dull hue and it also keep perfectly still playing dead doe it think it can escape by not moving asked emile doubtless because then even if it should by any chance be discovered it would probably be mistaken for a grain of earth wouldnt it be better for it to fly away or run away than to play dead it flight is too heavy and it leg too short all insect that can not take instant flight and are without mean of defense do a doe the vinefretter in time of danger they remain perfectly motionless nearly always this expedient succeeds with them because their color commonly a dull one cause them to be confounded with the soil ah the sly rogue well then this ruse of the vinefretter must be turned to account by u in our effort to exterminate the insect under the vine we stretch a cloth after which a sharp blow is given to the main stem the vinefretters let themselves fall they play dead but they can be seen on the cloth and not one escape the sad fate awaiting it clever mischiefmakers here is another weevil i have to show you began uncle paul the next day what do you think of it note it shiny violet coat with glint of blue that bring out the delicate down with which the whole body is covered the purple of our richest silk is not so magnificent oh the pretty little thing cried emile what can it do with it beautiful clothes nothing to our advantage my boy fine clothes do not make useful citizen either among insect or among men the bee dress is a modest brown and the bee work at honeymaking the dress of the weevil i show you here is very handsome but the elegant creature life at our expense if you have in your garden any fine plum or pear or apple it get ahead of you in harvesting the crop it doe not even wait for the fruit to ripen so fearful is it of being too late in june it puncture with it pointed snout the young apple or pear or plum and lay an egg in the unripe flesh the fruit thus treated feed the larva for some time and then dry up and fall off then the worm emigrates leaf the plum that ha nourished it and buries itself in the ground to reappear the next spring a a perfect insect i should like to know the name of this plumpricker id teach it to behave if i got hold of it it is called very inappropriately the rhynchites bacchus bacchus if i remember rightly said jules is the god of wine exactly and that is where the word is out of place here no doubt the first observer confounded the weevil of our orchard with that of our vineyard giving to the former the name that should belong to the latter but the mistake ha been made and we cant do anything about it now let u keep the name a they are but not confound the two weevil so different in appearance and habit the weevil that roll the vine leaf is hairless and of a goldengreen color the other is all covered with hair and it color is a lustrous violet to avoid confusion in our talk why should we not call this latter insect the plumweevil or the pearweevil that would be a good name for it assented louis i shall just call it the plumpricker declared emile there is no reason why you should not his uncle agreed now let u pas on to another member of the family see what widely dissimilar habit there are in a group of insect in which the expert eye can nevertheless perceive close resemblance i might almost say a near relationship some roll grape or oak or poplar leaf others puncture fruit with the beak this one here that i am going to tell you about severspartly never whollythe tip of young and tender shoot of various fruittrees hence they are commonly known a budcutters it is a weevil but much smaller than that of the grapevine the adjective conical is given to it on account of the shape of it thorax or breastplate which taper a little toward the front like a sugarloaf it is rather lustrous and of a blue color shading into green it show remarkable cleverness in it operation establishing itself in spring on a pear cherry apricot plum or hawthorn tree indifferently it selects one by one the shoot that suit it and in the not yet unfolded terminal bud it bore with it beak a tiny hole in which it lay an egg but it appears that the young larva requires a diet especially prepared for it one that is slightly decomposed and not the bitter juice of the vigorously growing shoot have not we ourselves similar taste do we eat medlar and sorbapples just a they come from the tree no indeed they must first be left to ripen on straw even to decay a little then they are firstrate wa emile pronouncement but before that they are horrid that is what the larva of the weevil would say about the shoot on which it ha just hatched out before being treated it is bitter it rasp the throat and set the mandible on edge after treatment it is delicious yet it doesnt put the branch to ripen on straw a we do medlar no in most case larvæ show no ingenuity whatever they eat like glutton and without a thought for anything but eating you know well enough that giving oneself up to gorging is hardly the way to improve the mind for these larvæ then a readymade pap ha to be provided a otherwise not knowing how to prepare it themselves they would stupidly starve to death and who prepares the food and make it just right for them the mother if you please the mother whose great and only occupation it is to provide for the future need of her unborn young she make it her business to find for them food that not only ha no nourishment in it for herself but which she dislike she denies herself the enjoyment of flowery field and summer sunshine to devote all her energy to arduous labor that are of no advantage to her personally and when she ha spent her little span of life at this hard task she retires into a corner and dy content the table is set the young larvæ will not lack for food when you see the weevil on a vine leaf sparkling like a precious gem do not think it is there to enjoy itself it is spending itself in the difficult undertaking of sawing the leaf halfway through at the stem after which it will roll the leaf into a sheath to serve a lodging and first food for the larvæ it whole life of two or three week is given to this work how can it benefit the insect itself to saw leaf stem and make the leaf wither in the sun and then roll them up in no way whatever the weevil doe not eat these leaf or lodge in the sheath made by rolling one of them up it spends it energy in this work solely for the larvæ that are to be hatched out after it death have you ever reflected my child on this perpetual miraclethe miracle of a mother living only for her little one little one that she is destined never to see i will not conceal from you that every time i think of this maternal foresight this laborious preparation for a future unknown to the mother herself i feel myself deeply moved the allseeing eye is there in a way peculiar to itself the conical weevil make ready the pap that is to feed it family the larvæ a i said require the mild juice of a shoot that ha been deprived of it natural vigor what doe the mother do to put the branch in the proper condition under the spot where the egg is laid she cut away the bark and some of the wood in a circle with her fine mandible leaving the shoot supported only by the central portion of the stem the sap no longer circulating beyond this girdle the leaf affected soon wither and the entire tip of the shoot turn black and acquires that state of decay best liked by the newborn grub i knew how to ripen medlar on straw said emile but i should have been puzzled to tell how to ripen a branch of a tree what curious creature those are with their clever way of doing thing one can do one thing and another can do another and it is always ingenious and never the same it is vexatious that all too often the insect labor involve harm and loss to u when a fruittree ha been operated on by the conical weevil you can see in the month of may the tip of the shoot hanging withered and blackened after which they dry up and fall do the larvæ stay in the tip of the fallen branch asked jules what would they do there food would fail them and so they bury themselves in the ground to finish their growth and pas the winter there snugly and safely in the spring their metamorphosis take place then to guard against insect ravage for the next year said louis the withered shoot that hang from the tree should be collected and burned while the larvæ are still there yes that is the best thing to do nutweevils and flowerweevils ha you rascal ive caught you at it now eating my hazelnut cried louis one day on seeing a weevil piercing with it long beak a still tender young nut ive caught you at it but first ill learn all about you and then well have a reckoning the weevil wa placed in a paper cornucopia together with some pierced hazelnut and in his first spare moment louis hastened to uncle paul house his cheek flushed with excitement little louis wa very fond of hazelnut and to catch in the very act the insect that attack them wa a very serious matter to his thinking in the evening uncle paul had his usual audience around him to listen to his account of the hazelnutweevil here is the little insect louis ha caught he began look at it beak a moment what a nose exclaimed emile oh what a nose it is a slender a a hair and very long and turned back at the end doesnt it look a if it were smoking a long pipe a i said the other day asked louis see uncle emile pointed out how close together it eye are they almost touch each other and the insect seems to be squinting how funny it is with it nose like a pipestem and it squinting eye where is it mouth asked jules at the very end of what emile call it long nose his uncle replied how doe it manage to eat food must have a hard time getting through that stem not so big around a a thread yes how doe it manage to eat emile chimed in i should be in a terrible fix if i had to take my food through a straw a long a myself the weevil is obliged to exercise moderation at the most it drink with it beak only a few drop of sap from the hazelnuttree it inhabits but if the weevil is temperate in it diet the larva of the weevil eats with a good appetite it demand the whole kernel of a hazelnut and it is on purpose to give the larva this food that the weevil is provided with the long beak that astonishes you the perfect insect i repeat life much more for it future family than for itself it equipment being designed with reference to the future of it young if the weevil had to think merely of it own food it trumpet would be highly inconvenient but it must above all look out for the wellbeing of it larvæ and to make provision for that the creature long and slender beak is a wonderful tool serving a a fine gimlet for boring through the nutshell so that the egg may be laid in the very meat itself and the larva be hatched out in the lap of plenty that must be a long hard job for so fine a gimlet jules remarked not at all the tiny mandible at the end of the trumpet bite the shell almost a easily a an edged tool of steel would do it and moreover the weevil chooses it time it is in may when the hazelnut are beginning to grow and their shell are soft that the task is undertaken the insect attack the nut at the base through the green covering called the cup a soon a the hole is made an egg is laid inside the nut and in a week the larva is hatched out it is a legless worm white with a red head a the grub eats very little at first the hazelnut continues to grow and it kernel to ripen though gnawed little by little when august come the store of provision is exhausted and the wormy nut lie on the ground then the worm it mandible strong by this time make a round hole in the empty shell and leaving the nut buries itself in the ground where it undergoes transformation the following spring when i am cracking nut with my teeth said emile i once in a while bite into something bitter and soft that is the grub of the weevil pah the nasty thing how can i keep the creature off my hazelnuttrees asked louis that is very simple gather the wormy nut which sooner or later fall to the ground just a doe fruit attacked by insect if they are not pierced with a large hole the worm is still there by burning them you destroy the weevil of the following year but this year weevil will be left no for it is a rule that insect die soon after laying their egg you havent told u the name of this hazelnuteater said jules it is called the hazelnutbalaninus or hazelnutweevil and you can easily recognize it by it very fine long and recurved beak a also by the yellowishgray down that cover the whole of the insect another balaninus smaller but of the same shape and color life in acorn in it larva state and is known a the oakbalaninus a third not very often seen around here life in cherrystone it is the cherrybalaninus how different they all are in their way of living jules remarked the grainweevil gnaws the kernel of grain the vineweevils and fruitweevils roll leaf or prick pear and plum or cut the bud and now here are the nutweevils that attack the hazelnutmeat the cherrystone and the acorn are there any that eat flower indeed there are no part of a plant is spared by insect the appletree the peartree and the cherrytree have each it peculiar weevil that in it larva state life at the expense of the flower bud these ravagers are called by a greek name meaning flowereaters see this appletree weevil the one most familiar to u it is brown with a small white stripe edged with black and placed slantwise on the end of each wing sheath beginning in april it spread over the appletrees and pierce the flower bud with it fine beak laying an egg in each one a week later the larva is hatched out and immediately the little worm begin to gnaw the flower that is curled up in the bud only the outside covering is left intact by this devourer of course a bud that ha had it heart eaten out can not blossom and so flower and fruit are both lost the damaged bud being gnawed only within keep their shape and take in drying the appearance of clove those clove that mother ambroisine put in stew asked emile the same what are clove they are a i have already told you 10 the bud or unopened flower of the clovetree an aromatic bush growing in hot country they are gathered before opening and are dried in the sun i see why bud pricked by the flowerweevil look like clove in both case they are bud that have dried up without opening the larva of the flowerweevil like those of weevil in general is a tiny legless worm white in color it doe not leave the bud it ha gnawed when this fall from the tree the larva of the nutweevil leaf it nut by boring a hole through the shell that of the conical weevil leaf the fallen shoot the vineweevil let itself drop out of it rolled leaf and all three bury themselves in the ground to pas the winter in safety and be transformed the following spring the larva of the flowerweevil is more expeditious it change into an insect take place a soon a it ha eaten it bud so that there is no need for it to leave it quarter a animal never do anything without a purpose the grub remains shut up in the dry bud six week after the egg is laid the larva emerges transformed into a perfect insect and flit from one appletree to another all summer then come the winter that must be a trying time said jules many perish but others survive hidden under moss in the crack of bark or among dry leaf indeed there are plenty of them left to destroy the bud on our appletrees when spring come the flowerweevil of the peartree and that of the cherrytree resemble the one i have just shown you and their habit are exactly the same it is not easy to get rid of these flowerdestroyers if one had only a few tree to take care of and those easy to get at in every part one could if necessary gather and burn the dry bud inhabited by the larvæ by this painstaking process some of the following year fruit might be saved but not even so should we get rid of all the flowerweevils a these insect fly well and far and they would come from the surrounding region after we had destroyed all our own besides the gathering of injured bud is impracticable on a large scale will these little flowereaters come to be master of our orchard asked jules will they destroy our apple and pear in the bud and cant we do anything to prevent it they would indeed be master had we not vigilant guard sharpeyed helper that from sunrise to sunset lie in wait for insect and hunt them with a patience skill and industry that none of u would be capable of you mean the bird said emile yes the bird when you see on an appletree in bloom a little bird hopping from branch to branch warbling and pecking thank god my child for giving u the charming creature that with every peck of it beak delivers u from an enemy enemy of clover would you like to see another little creature that by reason of it very smallness and it countless number brave our wrath and commits ravage that can be checked only by our agricultural helper the foe of our foe here it is i see it with it long beak cried jules it is another weevil oh how tiny it is exclaimed emile surely it cant eat very much it is small but so numerous that to feed it larvæ it requires whole field of clover not the entire plant but only the blossom a with the larvæ of the flowerweevil what glutton they think they must have blossom tender and sweetsmelling it is the cloverweevil and it measure scarcely three millimeter in length the body of a uniform black is slightly globular behind you know clover well enough with it blossom massed in a round head well the cloverweevil lay it egg on the flowerhead before the blossom open without boring into each flower separately to lay it egg in jules inquired the weevil doe not take that trouble the larvæ must manage for themselves a soon a it is hatched out each one pierce the base of the flower that suit it and work it way inside once there it eats the heart of the bud especially the part that would have become fruit the little pod with it seed that done it take on it insect form another weevil equally small and equally numerous run neck and neck with this one in destroying clover blossom it is black with yellow leg both abound in cultivated field in winter they can be found gathered at the foot of tree waiting for the clover to bloom before they go to work you might think these two weevil enough to destroy this useful forage plant but there are others still some larger and some smaller and all eager to get at the poor clover it would almost seem a if insect had agreed to attack especially those plant that are useful to man they set to work by three by four by ten and even by hundred if need be to carry out their ruinous operation some on the flower others on the root and still others on the leaf and stem of our most valuable plant the grapevine ha it caterpillar beetle and louse wheat feed destroyer still more numerous and varied such a weevil moth white worm gnat and many others and for the peartree alone we can count five hundred ravagers perhaps more do they want to starve u then jules again inquired what shall i say they go to work in a way to frighten one you ask their motive i will try to show you some other time but now let u finish our talk on the enemy of clover this one here in my hand is known by the learned a the cloverhylast it is a tiny brown beetle with truncated wing sheath like those of the barkbeetle which it closely resembles in fact it belongs to the same family while the cloverweevil is busy destroying the blossom this creature stay in the ground and gnaws the root of the plant we have now the root the blossom and the young shoot devoured who will look after the leaf i reply a little beetle with a rounded back and a flattened stomach and called the globular lasia i will do it so that man shall not find anything to mow after we get through with the clover you are familiar with the ladybird or ladybug that little red beetle with tiny black spot on it back the good god insect never molest it when you find it in the garden it work for u going from one plant to another devouring louse those potbellied creature that in countless swarm infest the tender shoot of plant and suck the sap the ladybird eats our enemy plantlice it dotes on them do not disturb it the insect known a the globular lasia is of the same family a the ladybird and like the latter it is round and red and ha black spot but they are placed differently and usually number about a dozen on each wing sheath the larva is yellow and all bristling with little hair that stand up like tiny thorn both the larva and the mature insect live not on louse but on leaf whether of clover vetch lucerne or some other plant the mark they make on the gnawed leaf look like furrow made by a fourtoothed comb finally who is to take in hand the stem of the clover this task will fall to various caterpillar equipped with good teeth and strong jaw a for example the glyphic noctua a rather pretty moth with upper wing bearing irregular spot encircled each by a lightgray thread on a brown background and lower wing brightly spotted with a light shade of yellow on every part of the clover on stem and blossom leaf and root ravenous devourer are now installed have i exhausted the list by no mean there are others in plenty if only to take the leaving of those i have named cabbageeaters one day jacques came in from the garden with a cabbage root all covered with wart having the shape and size of a pea in each wart wa a little worm some of the cabbage are withering away announced the old gardener though there are no worm on the leaf i think the trouble come from the wart on the root you have guessed right my good jacques replied uncle paul leave me that root and pull up all the cabbage that appear to you to be affected of course you will burn all the diseased root by so doing you will arrest the evil in the beginning a the insect causing the mischief is rare with u the important thing is not to let it multiply in the garden even if we have to throw away many of the cabbage in exterminating it uncle paul instruction were followed and no more warty root have been seen since next day the cabbage enemy were the subject of conversation cultivated plant said uncle paul are more exposed to the ravage of insect than the same plant in a wild state because they are of a finer flavor tenderer and of more luxuriant growth let u first consider the cabbage now that jacques ha furnished u the occasion look at this root quite covered with ugly wart hollow inside i open one what do we find within a small worm a larva that would if left undisturbed develop into a weevil with a beak that lie down on the breast between the foreleg when the insect curl up and play dead this weevil is known to men of science a belonging to a genus called ceuthorhynchus a name formed from two greek word and meaning snouthider it is black with grayish hair on the back and white scale on the belly it thorax ha a deep furrow and it wing sheath are ornamented with fine parallel groove it lay it egg about the beginning of summer the insect work it way down to the root and puncture it here and there with it beak laying an egg in each puncture in flowing around the wounded part the sap of the plant form a knob or fleshy wart in which the larva grows until the end of october when the worm leaf this nest to bury itself in the ground safe from the cold and undergo transformation the punctured root exhaust it energy in bleeding sap to form the wart occupied by the larvæ so that the cabbage rapidly withers away and in this manner the cabbageweevil make itself an enemy much to be feared especially in england where it is extremely common nor doe it confine it depredation to cabbage it attack turnip also and radish and rape this weevil seems to eat a good many thing said jules i thought each kind of insect always fed on one particular plant you were not far wrong my boy in most case insect have very exclusive taste each confining itself to one kind of plant and disdaining all others sometimes however they vary their diet and a they are connoisseur very well up on vegetable flavor in changing their food they choose plant having nearly identical nutritive property taste and smell do not we ourselves find in the radish and the turnip something of the smell and taste of the cabbage thats so assented louis we find more or le similarity in the quality characteristic of a great many other plant grouped together by botanist in the family of cruciferæ and including for instance the cress the radish and colza botanist cruciferæi dont know very well what those are said emile no those are strange word to you botanist are learned person who spend their time studying plant and who tell u their name and property difference and resemblance where they grow and when they blossom with other matter of that sort and cruciferæ that word mean crossbearers and is applied to a large group of plant with blossom having four piece or petal placed two by two opposite each other so a to form a sort of cross a good example is the colza blossom plant with crossshaped flower include the cabbage rape turnip radish clove colza cress and many others they are all cruciferæ yes all cruciferæ but their likeness is not confined to the shape of the blossom their inner property also such a smell taste and the rest are the same or very nearly so consequently the cabbageweevil a knowing a little creature a can be found go to the turnip when there are no cabbage to be had to the colza if turnip also are lacking or to other plant still but always to some member of the cruciferæ family other insect show this same peculiarity each specie having it particular group of plant and going from one to another without ever making a mistake a to family then they are expert botanist i should say jules remarked one might almost think so at least they show in their choice so keen a discernment that often men of science go to school to them to learn the various degree of relationship in the plant world oh uncle paul you are joking exclaimed jules joking listen you know the nasturtium that beautiful orangecolored flower ending at the bottom in a kind of horn and you know the mignonette that sweetsmelling plant that mother ambroisine grows in the window yes i know them then tell me whether you find between mignonette nasturtium and cabbage any resemblance any sign of plantrelationship no indeed those three plant are wholly unlike one another their flower havent the same shape nor their leaf nor yet their fruit well my dear boy you who rather pride yourself on knowing something about flower really know much le about them than a poor little green caterpillar very common in our garden and many person of far more learning than you could take lesson from this same caterpillar it feed indifferently on various cruciferæ such a the cabbage rape and the turnip but it also feed on the nasturtium and the mignonette why you must ask the scientist who make a thorough study of plant and are determined to find out the minutest detail concerning them they would tell you that there is something in their innermost structure something invisible to our untrained eye that make the nasturtium and the mignonette very nearly akin to the cruciferæ without looking like them it is enough to puzzle anybody i admit a worthless caterpillar ha from the beginning of the world eaten mignonette a well a turnip cabbage a well a nasturtium and ha been familiar with plantrelationships unsuspected by science until our own time i should like to see this caterpillar that know so much about plant your desire shall be gratified without delay a destructive family they went out to the garden and uncle paul hunted for some time in the cabbage bed before he found what he wanted here is the caterpillar we were talking about he announced at last it is of a delicate green color with three yellow stripe running lengthwise now you must make the acquaintance of the butterfly jules go and bring me the net uncle paul had a large gauze net the mouth of which wa attached to a hoop of coarse iron wire fastened to the end of a long stick that wa his butterflynet and in his leisure moment he used it for catching butterfly that he might destroy them before they laid their egg on the plant in the garden the more butterfly destroyed the fewer hundred of caterpillar a little later jules came back with the net but the chase did not accomplish the desired result though another butterfly wa caught very much like the one they were after we must be content with this said uncle paul my butterflyhunting of the last few day seems to have left u none of the sort i am looking for so we will not waste any more time the insect i have just caught is known a the cabbagebutterfly it wing are white the forward one having black tip and two or three spot of the same color in the middle i see that butterfly everywhere declared emile it is in fact one of the most widely prevalent specie it caterpillar is greenish marked with black dot and three longitudinal yellow stripe it doe not spin a cocoon for it metamorphosis the chrysalis is spotted with yellow and black and is found near where the caterpillar lived suspended from a wall or a tree in a very ingenious manner before shedding it skin the caterpillar emits it small supply of liquid silk gluing the end of it tail to the spot it ha selected and then spinning a fine band which it pass across it body fastening the two end at right and left on the stone or the bark to which it is clinging these preliminary concluded the chrysalis stage is reached the chrysalis being held firmly in place with it lower end glued to the supporting object and it upper half kept from falling by the silk band without any cocoon to protect it asked emile without any cocoon whatever hence it is called a naked chrysalis many other caterpillar adopt the same method having only a scanty little drop of liquid silk much too small a quantity for spinning a cocoon they content themselves when their metamorphosis approach with gluing their tail to some object and supporting themselves further with a narrow band it is to be noted that butterfly from caterpillar that do not spin cocoon all have very slender antennæ ending abruptly in a rounded protuberance or swelling and that they fly by day in the brightest sunshine they are butterfly proper a distinguished from moth these latter have the chrysalis enclosed in a cocoon and their antennæ are sometimes of a feathery appearance sometimes spindleshaped or they may take the form of elongated club or finally they may be threadlike tapering but little toward the end they fly mostly in the evening twilight or even in the night compare the antennæ of the cabbagebutterfly with those of the silkwormmoth or the leopardmoth and you will see how easy it is to distinguish a butterfly from a moth a cocoonless from a cocoonspinning insect then thats all you have to dojust see whether the antennæ end in a little round swelling said jules with something on the antennæ repeated emile no cocoon without that a cocoon how easy it is a the youngest and giddiest of my hearer ha understood my explanation so well i will pas on let u return to the butterfly whose caterpillar is so interesting to jules because it eats indifferently cabbage turnip radish nasturtium and mignonette this butterfly is very much like the cabbagebutterfly it too is white with black spot on the forward wing but not of so deep a shade furthermore it is about a third smaller it is called the radishbutterfly to distinguish these two specie so much alike in coloring and both feeding on the same plant gardener call the former the big cabbagebutterfly and the latter the little cabbagebutterfly i know those butterfly jules interposed many a time ive seen both kind on the flower in the garden and i got them mixed because there is hardly any difference in their color now i shall know how to tell them apart the larger one is the cabbagebutterfly the smaller the radishbutterfly you must bear in mind that the word cabbage and radish used to designate the two butterfly do not mean that the caterpillar of the one eats exclusively cabbage and that of the other only radish a a matter of fact the name could be reversed without any impropriety for both caterpillar a occasion offer feed on either the cabbage the radish the turnip or some other cruciferous plant but let it be noted also that these two term have been chosen a substantially true to the fact though likely to mislead if taken in too literal a sense the same remark applies to a third specie the turnipbutterfly whose caterpillar feed not only on the leaf of turnip plant but also on those of the nasturtium the mignonette the radish cabbage and many other crucifer it is of about the size of the radishbutterfly and it wing are white with greenish vein underneath the forward wing have also black spot on their upper surface the caterpillar is slightly hairy and of a uniform green color with no yellow stripe running lengthwise flier with wing of gauze questioned a to the mean to be adopted in order to protect from their insect enemy the various plant he had mentioned in his last talk uncle paul wa forced to acknowledge the inadequacy of any preventive measure at our command for protecting a few square yard of cabbagepatch from these devourer he explained a rigorous search for worm and an incessant chase after butterfly on that particular piece of land might prove effective but how keep watch over acre and acre with butterfly and moth of many kind flying all about and alighting every moment to lay their egg the cost of any such watchfulness would far exceed the value of the crop and so it is in general with all raising of farm product on a large scale when once the enemy is in possession it is all but impossible to drive him out if we depend on our own resource however much we may spend in the attempt because of their infinite number the insect always have the advantage of u but fortunately there are others fighting for u and they wage valiant warfare against our insect foe especially against worm and caterpillar you mean the bird asked jules yes and other equally useful helper that you have never heard of notwithstanding the immense service they render u i refer to the insect belonging to the order known a hymenoptera hymenoptera ive never heard that word before and for that reason i hasten to explain it meaning to you you are familiar with the honeybee the bumblebee and the wasp like butterfly they have four wing for flying but these wing instead of being covered with scalesthose scale that come off on your hand and look like dustare simply membrane of a transparent or gauzy appearance hence the name hymenoptera that is given to these insect a latin name that may be translated a membranouswinged creature furthermore they have at the end of the abdomen a very fine sting which come out of it sheath when the irritated insect seek to defend itself by pricking the venturesome finger that have seized it in other specie this sting is represented sometimes by a kind of saw or cutlas sometimes by a blade more or le long and slender hidden in a fold of the stomach or else projecting and open to view well insect thus armed with a sting a saw or a blade and having four membranous wing a fine and transparent a those of the honeybee the bumblebee and the wasp are called hymenoptera they form an order just a butterfly and moth form the order of lepidoptera and insect with sheath protecting the lower pair of wing form the order of coleoptera the grasshopper jules observed ha a kind of sword on the end of it body but it hasnt the bee fine transparent wing therefore it is not one of the hymenoptera the grasshopper doesnt hurt any one with it sword doe it asked emile no it us this tool simply for placing it egg in the ground where they are to hatch it is a sort of conveyor for the egg and is called a terebra the saw the blade the cutlas and other like implement that terminate the body of various insect have also this name they serve to deposit the egg in suitable place where the larvæ can find food but this implement dangerous though it look never sting when the insect is molested it is not a defensive weapon only the honeybee the bumblebee the wasp and some others have for their defense a sting that inflicts a painful wound so painful emile interrupted that i still remember how once when i wanted to see what wa going on in the beehive i wa stung by the bee the wasp sting is much worse remarked louis when i wa gathering the grape last year i took hold of a bunch where there were some wasp and my hand wa swollen all day and pained me so i should have cried if there had been nobody around how wonderful that such small creature really hurt like that jules exclaimed i should like to know why i will tell you the sting of these insect is a slender lancet hard and sharppointed a kind of dagger finer than the finest needle it is situated at the end of the abdomen in repose it is not seen being concealed in a sort of scabbard let into the creature body but in time of danger it come out of this scabbard now it is not exactly the wound made by the sting that cause the smarting pain you know so well this wound is so slight so subtle that we can not see it and we should hardly feel it if it were made by a needle or a thorn a fine a the sting but the sting communicates with a venomsac lodged in the insect body and through a tiny channel running the length of the sting there is injected into the very heart of the wound a minute quantity of a highly dangerous liquid after this injection the sting is withdrawn while the venom remains in the wound and that is what cause the pain learned men who have studied this curious subject relate the following experiment which wa performed in order to prove that it is the venomous liquid introduced into the wound and not the wound itself that cause the pain when one prick oneself with a very fine needle the pain is of no consequence and pass almost immediately well the prick of a needle insignificant in itself can be made very painful indeed if the little wound is poisoned with venom from a bee or a wasp the learned men i just spoke of dipped the point of a needle into the bee venomsac and with the needle thus moistened lightly pricked themselves the pain that followed wa severe and protracted even severer and of longer duration than if the insect itself had stung the experimenter this difference is to be explained by the fact that the needle large in comparison with the insect sting introduced into the wound much more venom than the sting itself could have conveyed now you understand i hope that it is the injection of the venom into the wound that cause all the mischief that is plain enough assented jules the bee sting is barbed continued uncle paul that is to say it is furnished with teeth somewhat like those of a saw and pointing backward in it haste to fly away after stinging the bee doe not always succeed on account of these teeth in drawing out the sting from the wound it ha inflicted and thus the sting is wrenched from the bee body to the endangering of the insect life the venomsac is left behind also it is that little white globule one see outside the wound and at the base of the sting if the person stung hastening to extract the sting is awkward enough to press on the little sac a great part of the venom is likely to be injected into the wound with a corresponding increase of pain this is a warning to you whenever you are stung by a bee to draw out the sting cautiously and to be careful not to press on the venomsac beneficent parasite continuing the subject of the day before uncle paul laid emphasis on the distinction between those hymenopterous insect that sting and those that do not at the end of the abdomen said he the one class have a poisoned weapon for selfdefense a in bee and wasp while the other class are furnished simply with the implement called a terebra sometimes concealed in a fold of the skin sometimes standing out in full view and used not for stinging but for introducing the creature egg into such place a will provide the nourishment required by the future brood insect of this latter class are called by the general name of ichneumon this morning emile caught one which i will show you i found it on a flower said emile and i wrapped a handkerchief round my hand for fear of being stung the thing it ha sticking out at the end of it body look rather dangerous the precaution wa needle his uncle assured him no ichneumon however long it terebra may be can sting your hand the hymenopter that are to be feared have their sting hidden and they bring it out only at the moment of attack those three threadlike thing a long a the insect bodywhat are they for asked jules the two lateral one unite and form a scabbard for holding and protecting the middle one the most important of the three for it is used to deposit the egg at the point chosen a suitable by the insect ive seen ichneumon very much like this one said louis with the terebra stuck right into the thick bark of a poplar they must have been laying their egg in the wood under the bark no they were doing something better than that the larvæ of ichneumon live in the body of other larvæ which they devour little by little without killing them until the very last they are carnivorous larvæ they must have fresh meat that is renewed about a fast a they eat it the ichneumon louis speaks of were engaged in depositing their egg in the body of plump worm that live in the wood of the tree and turn into beetle but these beetleworms jules pointed out were not in sight they were under the bark and perhaps in the wood itself the ichneumon doe not need to see them to know where they are doe it hear them then no more than it see them the worm stay quietly in it little tunnel being careful not to make any noise that will attract the attention of it enemy then the ichneumon must at least smell them that is very doubtful a live larva ha no odor and besides the most difficult part is not to find out whether or not a suitably plump larva is there under the bark at such and such a depth it is also necessary to ascertain whether another ichneumon egg ha not already been laid in the body of the coveted worm a one larva would be insufficient for two nursling an egg deposited in some fat worm is not seen heard or felt that is very evident nevertheless the ichneumon never plunge it terebra through the bark into a larva already occupied what guide it i do not know nobody know instinct ha way and mean unsuspected by our wisdom an ichneumon alights on the trunk of a tree the perfectly healthy bark betrays to the sharpest eye no sign of what the hymenopter is after never mind the insect soon satisfies itself a to whether or not the place is a good one for it purpose it make a careful examination tapping with it antennæ and keeping up a continual vibratory movement a spot is chosen the insect plant itself firmly on it leg draw up it abdomen and holding it terebra in a vertical position plunge the point of it into an imperceptible fissure in the bark the little auger pierce the bark though not without effort and occasional pause for there are difficulty to be overcome nevertheless it go a far a it length permit the end is attained the point of the instrument penetrates the flesh of the worm hidden under the bark the egg being deposited in the incision thus made the insect withdraws it blade carefully so a not to break it and proceeds to lay egg in the body of other larvæ then the great length of this blade jules remarked though at first it seems unhandy for the creature is on the contrary perfectly fitted for the work to be done with too short a terebra the ichneumon couldnt reach the larvæ under the bark and even in the wood itself from the length of the terebra one can estimate at what depth a a rule the egg are laid ichneumon with a long terebra lay their egg in larvæ protected by a thick layer of bark or wood or earth or other material those with a short terebra seek larvæ living in the open air such a caterpillar for example however if the caterpillar is covered with long hair thus keeping the ichneumon at a distance from the skin of it victim a long implement is still necessary to convey the egg into the flesh but for smoothskinned caterpillar without any defense the ichneumon is furnished with a very short terebra often invisible when not in action so that the end of the insect abdomen must be pressed in order to make the eggconveyer show itself be it lancet saw fine blade or other instrument of that sort the ichneumon on the hunt is one of the most curious sight imaginable caterpillar are peacefully browsing on leaf an ichneumon come along fly about over them selects the one that look best for it purpose and never fails to exclude those that already have egg in their body at the sound of their enemy wing the terrified caterpillar stop eating and begin to move their head in a startled manner from side to side doubtless in the hope of frightening off the foe but the latter pay no attention to these vain threat it alights on the caterpillar of it choice and so quickly that you hardly have time to see the operation dart it terebra and lay an egg in the wound and doesnt the caterpillar make any resistance asked emile it performs some lively antic but that is all the poor creature can not defend itself against an enemy in the air a winged enemy that can always keep at a safe distance and is always ready to fly away the other eligible caterpillar in the group are attacked in the same manner one by one until the ichneumon ha laid all it egg each caterpillar get only one egg asked jules that depends on the size of the egglayer if it is large it lay but one egg in each caterpillar so that the larvæ may each have enough food if small it lay several and then what happens emile inquired the ichneumon gone the pricked caterpillar soon recover their composure and resume their eating the prick not being poisoned with venom cause very little pain besides it would take a good deal more than that to affect their appetite all go well for a few day a long a the egg are unhatched do those egg hatch in the caterpillar body yes and a soon a they have hatched do the little larvæ set to work devouring the caterpillar inside thats the way of it what an awful stomachache for the poor caterpillar nevertheless even with such pain a may result from the gradual consumption of their flesh the caterpillar continue to eat a if nothing had happened the satisfaction of their appetite making them forget their suffering so imperious is their need of food and furthermore for a reason that i will explain the parasitic worm observe a certain caution in their ravage in the body of every animal are certain organ more indispensable than others for the maintenance of life and if they are injured even though slightly death follows such are the heart and brain in the higher animal in a caterpillar body there are it is true no heart or brain like those of animal higher in the scale but there are analogous organ just a necessary to the ongoing of the vital function if the ichneumon larvæ in eating their victim flesh were to injure these vital organ the caterpillar would quickly die and the larvæ would perish too for they must have fresh meat not decayed flesh it is a question of life or death to them whether the grub avoid biting in the wrong place or not the caterpillar must live in order that they may live it must prolong it miserable existence until they are ready for their metamorphosis so the little parasite scrupulously respect any organ indispensable to the maintenance of life and feed on the rest guided by instinct they distinguish admirably between what they may attack and what they must let alone a time come however when because of their approaching transformation they do not need to exercise further selfrestraint and they accordingly devour the part until then left intact thereupon the caterpillar dy being reduced to an empty skin which the larvæ promptly abandon in order to spin their cocoon and turn into nymph and finally into ichneumon sometimes the caterpillar is spared until it ha shut itself up in a case and turned into a chrysalis with the result that the larvæ inhabiting the caterpillar find themselves without any labor on their part provided with snug quarter for the winter out of every such wormy chrysalis consumed to the skin there emerges in the spring not a butterfly but a swarm of ichneumon last autumn said jules i found in the garden a large brown cocoon and i hoped to see a beautiful butterfly come out of it but this spring to my great astonishment out came a swarm of little fly what you took for fly wa a brood of ichneumon yet there are fly real fly that lay their egg in the body of caterpillar just a the hymenopterous butterfly do with their terebra with their strange way of living on other creature observed louis ichneumon must destroy lot of caterpillar they destroy so many that often if you take a hundred caterpillar haphazard from cabbage or other growing vegetable you will find not more than two or three that are sound and in a condition to undergo metamorphosis can those that have egg in them be told from the rest asked louis easily the point pierced by the ichneumon terebra is surrounded by a little black spot when you are gathering caterpillar it is well not to crush those that you see are pricked nor yet those that look diseased and have a loose skin they are ichneumonfeeders and their preservation mean so many more swarm of ichneumon the next summer for the destruction of caterpillar appleeaters please tell u about the worm we find in apple and pear wa louis request one day when the child were gathered about their uncle that worm my lad he began a i have already briefly explained is the grub or larva of a small moth seems to me interrupted jules the moth is responsible for a good deal of mischief yes moth do more harm than any other insect but not a moth for these never give u any cause for complaint being content to suck a little honey through their slender trumpet from the flower growing on every side it is in the larva state with appetite of the most varied sort that they commit their ravage i have already told you about worm that gnaw wood and those that eat woolen stuff those that browse the foliage and those that attack root now we come to some that give their attention to fruit the bestknown of these is the worm that life in apple and pear we usually call it the appleworm and it moth is known a the applepyralis the term pyralis is new to you it come from a greek word meaning fire and wa long ago ignorantly applied to the applemoth because that insect wa supposed to eat fire a it regular diet it forward wing are ashgray streaked crosswise with brown and ornamented at the tip with a large red spot encircled by a goldenred border the rear wing are brown when the fruit is just beginning to form the pyralis lay an egg in the blossom end of apple or pear no matter which and the little worm that soon come from this egg take up it abode close to the seed the narrow channel by which it entered skin over so that the wormy fruit appears intact for some time meanwhile the worm is living in the lap of luxury with an abundance of it favorite food all around but it must have a passage communicating with the outside so a to get air and make the abode sanitary encumbered a it is with refuse and excrement accordingly the worm bore a little tunnel through the flesh of the fruit to the skin and through this also there the tunnel end in a round hole through this passageway the larva receives fresh air and throw out from time to time the chewed and digested pulp in the form familiar to u a reddish wormhole dust the translucent quality of it skin cause the worm to vary in hue according to the color of what it eats being sometimes white sometimes brown or yellow and sometimes pink it is ornamented with little black tubercle or pimple arranged in pair the head and the first ringlike section of the body are brown apple and pear containing worm continue to grow indeed they ripen sooner than the others but it is a sickly maturity that hastens the fall of the fruit a a rule the larva in wormy fruit that ha fallen to the ground is by that time fully grown accordingly it leaf it domicile by the passage already made and creep into some crevice in the bark of a tree or sometimes it retires underground after which it make for itself a shell of silk mixed with fragment of wood or dead leaf and turn into a moth the next year when all the young apple and pear are ready to receive it egg for the new generation in plum and apricot is found a worm closely resembling that infesting apple and pear another occurs in chestnut and a third in peapods the tender young pea furnishing excellent food for the intruder all these worm are the larvæ of moth commonly named from the fruit or vegetable they infest the peaworm after it ha devoured the best part of the pod content pass into another pod by boring a round hole it moth appears in june and the larva in july and august consequently spring pea are never wormy while those of late summer very often are this example show you how in certain instance a crop can be saved by hastening or delaying the sowing according to the time when the ravagers may be expected to appear but no such plan can be carried out with chestnut said emile that is plain enough for chestnuttrees bear their nut at a fixed time and we cant hurry them up or keep them back the chestnutmoth come just when the table is set for it young one what disgustinglooking worm they are tooall red and soaked in their own juice in the chestnutmeat we cant do anything either for the appletrees and the peartrees can we louis inquired not much some people gather the wormy apple and pear fallen from or still on the tree and crush them to kill the worm inside that make so many enemy the fewer for the following year but again it ha to be admitted that left to our own resource we could never defend ourselves against the pyralis and other similar moth that produce larvæ from which hardly anything is safe fortunately the swallow catch these moth on the wing bat chase them assiduously in the twilight and the little gray lizard snap them up when they alight on the trunk of tree these are so many friend protector of our garden and orchard the moth you call by that queer name pyralisare there a good many of them asked jules there are numerous specie and each specie is represented by countless legion of individual moth some of these attack fruit i have just told you about the principal one others have a different mode of life and of these i will speak tomorrow but they are all very small moth and some are beautifully colored their antennæ are fine and their wing rounding at the shoulder spread out in the form of a cape and are folded together in repose like the two half of a sloping roof that is they incline to right and left their grub have a smooth and shiny skin these worm draw back quickly when molested and let themselves fall to the ground deadening the shock of the fall by mean of a silk thread that hold them suspended by the lip thats a clever trick emile observed a soon a the worm is frightened it glue the end of the thread to something and down it drop but gently and only a fast a the thread is let out by the spinneret this morning said jules mother ambroisine wa picking over some dried pea a few were pierced with a round hole and others had a little brown insect spotted with white pea then have two enemy the pyralisworm that eats fresh fruit and the insect i am speaking of that eats them dry the insect that eats dried pea is a small beetle a weevil with a wide and very short snout it is known a the peaweevil another weevil eats bean and still another lentil it is always the larva that doe the mischief once arrived at the perfect state the weevil bore a round hole in the seed and get out these weevil have the same habit a the grainweevil they are destroyed by the use of sulphide of carbon or simply by the action of heat if the seed they infest are not to be sown for the temperature required to kill the insect and their larvæ would also destroy the germinative principle of the seed chapter l leafrollers many of the moth bearing the name of pyralis have a curious habit in their larva state of rolling up the leaf of tree or of folding them lengthwise or of uniting several in the form of a sheath by mean of silk thread so a to make a shelter in which they may nibble away in safety at the interior of their green abode for this reason they are called leafrollers the one best known on account of the damage it doe is the grapevinepyralis it is a small moth with yellow wing having the metallic sheen of copper and crossed by brown stripe it larva is greenish bristling with short hair and having a head of a dark lustrous green color in august the moth lay it egg on the vine leaf in little slab of twenty at most hatching take place in september at this advanced season of the year caterpillar do not eat they suspend themselves by a thread and wait for the wind to drive them against the vine or one of it support a soon a they get a foothold on the desired object they take refuge in crack in the bark and fissure in the wood and there they lie torpid through the winter at the reawakening of vegetable life and the first pushing forth of the new vine shoot they leave their winter quarter invade the vine and entwine with silk thread the young grape cluster and the tender leaf after which they feed upon them with an appetite sharpened by a fast of five or six month with such ravenous eater devastation proceeds apace and in a few week if the worm are numerous the most flourishing vine is reduced to a pitiful condition and all hope of a harvest is abandoned the ravage wrought by this moth between 1835 and 1840 in the vineyard of bourgogne will long be remembered over immense tract of land when vintagetime came there wa not a single bunch of grape to go into the basket the greedy caterpillar ruined the country didnt the people try to get rid of the creature asked louis they tried various method but with little success until finally one proved effective and that the simplest and cheapest of all let u note by the way my little friend what an advantage it is to be acquainted with the habit of an insect that doe u harm if this moth peculiarity had not been studied if it had not been known that it larvæ hide themselves in the fissure of the vine and the trellis there to lie torpid all winter our vineyard might still be suffering from this terrible enemy this fact being known the remedy wa not far to seek it is this in winter the vine and trellis are scalded with boiling water the water being heated over a fire in the middle of the vineyard with a coffeepot about a liter of hot water is poured on each vine so a to reach all the part where worm may be lurking protected by it tough bark the vine itself doe not suffer from this scalding bath while the caterpillar are completely destroyed by this method the vineyard of bourgogne were so entirely rid of the dreaded moth that no further ravage of any account have been reported couldnt the moth come back again some time a many a ever asked jules that is hardly possible if at their first appearance the coffeepot of hot water is brought into play the other leafrolling moth of this family are of le importance the leafroller of the plumtree life first on the blossom of the tree later it make a roll of leaf and line it with silk the moth ha a large white spot at the tip of each fore wing the cherrytree leafroller ha about the same habit it moth is recognized by two wide oblique stripe of the color of rust on it fore wing on the peartree life a leafroller with a triangular white spot in the middle of each fore wing i dont remember ever having seen the moth you are telling u about said jules they are too small to be noticed by any one who is not on the lookout for them i have often seen the nest of leafrolling caterpillar on fruittrees and bush and all sort of plant there are leaf folded lengthwise so that the edge join and make a sort of tunnel others are in two or three or more and there are some fastened together in a big bunch all twisted and ragged with silk thread holding them together on opening these nest of leaf and silk i have sometimes found a caterpillar and sometimes a spider various spider with too little silk to spin a large web for catching fly make an ambush by bringing the edge of two or three adjacent leaf together like the leafrolling caterpillar they use silk thread to hold the piece of their abode in place but their ultimate object is quite different the roller bring the leaf together so a to nibble them in peace safely hidden away in the shelter thus formed the spider bring them together to make a simple abode for themselves and an ambush from which they can pounce upon such insect a come within their reach the spider that make a nest of leaf joined together do not harm tree i should rather say they are helpful to tree they are vigilant guardian always on the watch for fly gnat little moth and other ravagers that would come and infest the tree with their egg chapter li the hopmoth what is that pretty butterfly in your box next to the pyralis emile asked his uncle when the latter wa showing the child some of his specimen of moth and butterfly it ha silver wing bordered with red that is not a butterfly my boy replied uncle paul it is a moth that infests hopvines are hop those thing they make beer with beer is not made from hop my boy it is made from barley first the barley is slightly moistened after which it is kept at a mild temperature the grain begin to sprout just a it would do if sown in the field for the nourishment of the little plant which have no root a yet a special food already prepared is needed just a the young kitten not yet big enough to catch mouse need it mother milk all grain in beginning to grow whether it be wheat or oat or rye or any other requires a special form of nourishment ready prepared but where do you suppose it is to be found you hadnt thought of that i will tell you the grain ha it in itself in a kernel of barley or wheat or oat or rye there is a white substance which when ground to powder is known a flour then the sprouting plant feed on flour not exactly flour is too coarse a food for it the little plant take it nourishment much a we do when we are very small it suck up water holding in solution the substance needed for it growth but flour will not dissolve in water a you very well know consequently the little plant would die of hunger right beside it store of provision if the flour were not prepared for iti might say cooked for itin a way suited to it need that must be a funny arrangementfood cooked for a plant it is more wonderful than you can imagine a the sprout push upward the flour in the grain is being turned to sugar real sugar very sweet and easily dissolved in water so that the young plant ha for it nourishment a sufficient supply of sweetened water or to express it in another way a sort of milk oh yes cried emile now i understand last christmas mother ambroisine put some wheat to sprout in a plate and kept it moist on the mantelpiece when the little blade began to show the wheat wa all soft and would crush under your finger and it gave out a sort of very sweet milk this wonderful transformation of flour into sugar during germination is turned to account by man in making beer he cause barley to germinate and when he judge that all the flour substance it contains ha turned to sugar he quickly kill the little plant a otherwise the sweetened liquid would be taken up by them and would undergo another transformation by being turned into plant substance accordingly the grain is promptly dried in an oven after which it is ground in a mill and this ground barley is called malt by adding water and keeping it at a mild temperature we induce a fresh change the sugar turn to alcohol which is the essential element of beer and wine the flour of the grain then said jules turn to sugar or to plant substance or to alcohol according to the way it is treated is that it yes and it can be converted into many other thing boiled with water it becomes paste after entering into the composition of beer it can be turned into vinegar by being left exposed to the air and allowed to sour but we will not now dwell on these various change let u return to the subject of beer in order to impart to that beverage the bitter taste and the aroma peculiar to it we use hop barley is the fundamental ingredient of the drink hop are the flavoring the hopplant is a long slender vine unable to hold itself up without supporting pole around which it twine to the height of perhaps ten meter it leaf are lobed somewhat like those of the grape and it fruit take the shape of cone or catkin similar to those of the pinetree but much smaller and composed of thin scale coated with a sort of bitter resin it is these cone that are used in making beer hop are extensively cultivated in alsace and in germany the chief enemy of the hopvine are two worm one of which nibble the root and the other the inside of the stem or vine the epialidæ are distinguished from all other moth by their very short antennæ their larvæ live in the ground and feed on root the most important member of this family is the hopmoth of which the male ha white wing touched with silver and edged with a reddish border and the female ha fore wing of bright yellow with tawny edge and two tawny oblique stripe the grub is whitish covered with little yellow tubercle overgrown with black hair it doe great damage to hop plantation by gnawing the root to destroy it the hopgrower is advised to spray the base of the vine with water in which hogmanure ha been left to steepan application that is said to kill the worm within the stem of the plant life the grub of the pyralis that i show you here the moth ha darkyellow fore wing edged with a scalloped stripe of a lighter shade and marked with a number of red spot the hind wing are white with purple spot and yellowish edge alongside of that moth there are two more in your box emile pointed out they are the maddermoth and the woadmoth madder used to be cultivated for it root which yield a red dye the most beautiful and lasting of all red dye isnt mother ambroisines sunday kerchief dyed with madder yes and with the red there are black pink garnet and violet on the kerchief all obtained from madder in the method formerly in use various drug were first applied to the good to be dyed this being done by mean of wooden block engraved with the desired pattern after which a bath of boiling water containing powdered madder root brought out all the different color at once their respective tint depending on the drug previously applied these color of which there were many variety had the great advantage of never fading in the sun and of resisting soap hence madder used to be the most highly prized of dyestuff and wa a source of much profit to alsace and the department of vaucluse the only district devoted to it culture it insect foe wa the moth i now show you at weedingtime it wa the custom to destroy the caterpillar which fed on the leaf of the plant woad is another plant used in dyeing prepared in a certain way the green matter of it leaf give a fine blue color the caterpillar of a leafrolling moth eats first the woad leaf and then the stalk chapter lii the inchworm one day uncle paul wa in his garden engaged in an operation on his peartrees that greatly puzzled emile and jules he had a pot of black sticky stuff with a strong smell and wa smearing it with a brush all around the base of the tree oh how oneeyed john would have laughed if he had peeped through the hedge and seen uncle paul daubing the foot of his peartrees with black but he would have been greatly in the wrong a is proved by what the boy uncle said to them that same evening what do you call that stuff you were putting on the tree this morning jules inquired it is called tar and is a substance derived from coal to make illuminating gas coal is put into large castiron vessel and heated redhot all outside air being excluded meanwhile the heat decomposes the coal which can not burn for want of air the product of this decomposition are illuminating gas tar and coke this last being a kind of coal of metallic appearance very porous and light the gas and the tar are drawn off through a pipe the coke remaining in the castiron vessel tar is a very black sticky substance with a strong odor repugnant to insect then you put a coating of it around the tree trunk to keep off insect certain moth whose caterpillar i fear came through my hedge the girdle of tar put on at the base of the trunk is to prevent their climbing to the branch to lay their egg in that way i protect the fruittrees from the caterpillar that a little later would destroy the foliage but moth can fly well enough and your tar wouldnt stop them if they cant reach the branch by climbing the trunk they will fly up to them for a moth that fly agreed if on the contrary it can not fly but ha to content itself with walking is it not true that the coating of tar encircling the foot of the tree trunk will prove an impassable obstacle in the first place the smell of tar is offensive to the moth and then if it venture on the sticky girdle it will infallibly become entangled and die stuck fast in the tar that is plain assented louis but are there any moth that cant fly there are are the lazy thing afraid to use their wing asked emile perhaps they think it too much trouble how could they use them they havent any to use poor thing that account for it then moth without wing yes my boy moth without wing you shall see some this one is called by learned men phalæna geometra which mean geometermoth you will soon see why it is so named but it ha wing magnificent one all dotted with brown spot on a yellowish background yes and i will add that the forward one have dark stripe now what do you think of this other moth that ugly thing isnt a moth you judge by appearance my dear child and not by reality this ungainly creature laboriously dragging along it big naked yellowish abdomen with large black spot is the female of the other moth i should never have guessed it neither you nor a great many others henceforth you will know that there are numerous specie of moth whose female are either wingless or equipped with such mere stump of wing that they are unable to fly whereas the male invariably have welldeveloped wing now the male is not the one to be feared it is the female with her egg the office of the tar girdle at the foot of the tree is to arrest the moth when it try to climb to the branch where the laying take place repulsed by the odor it turn back or if it persists in it endeavor to pas it stick to the tar and so perishes if the female laid her egg somewhere else suggested jules instead of on the branchesfor instance on the groundwouldnt the caterpillar know enough to climb the tree by themselves the tar barrier would still be there to stop them besides caterpillar hatched on the ground would hardly think of climbing the tree to the place where in the usual order the hatching would have taken place a long a the customary condition remain unaltered insect show an astonishing instinct beyond these condition they do not know how to act the caterpillar of the geometermoth is gray with a yellow stripe running lengthwise on each side it ha a curious way of walking common to it and other caterpillar of the same group these caterpillar are long and cylindrical in shape and they usually have but two pair of false leg at some distance from the true front leg in walking they first rest themselves on the forward leg and then bring up the others by curving the body into a loop or ring the next movement is to raise the forward leg and advance them in a stride a long a the creature itself after which the body again bend into a loop by the bringing up of the hind leg a before these peculiar stride give the worm the appearance of a pair of divider getting over the ground by alternately opening and closing it two leg you might say the creature survey or measure the road it travel and that is why it moth is known a the geometermoth the common name of inchworm applied to the caterpillar is familiar to you a referring to the caterpillar length further characteristic are to be noted clinging to the branch solely by their hind creeper these worm remain for hour in the strangest posture the body stiff and motionless you will see some stretched out straight some turned up behind some arched in a semicircular position not one move not one show weariness in these uncomfortable attitude which demand an incredible amount of strength you have witnessed the feat of those strongarmed acrobat who in the sideshow at the fair seize a vertical bar with both hand and without further support sustain themselves in the air the body horizontal inchworm do the same thing but with this difference whereas the acrobat are exhausted in a few moment the caterpillar keep their balance all day if necessary why do they do all those stunt wa emile question they are not doing stunt a you call it they are simply using their natural mean of escaping observation on the part of their enemy by reason of their complete immobility rigid posture and grayish hue they are confounded with the small dry twig which they closely resemble unless examined at very short range they deceive all eye even those of bird whose sight is so keen ah the crafty rogue to stiffen themselves and stay perfectly still so a to look like little dry twig and in that way fool the bird that would come and snap them up is a very clever trick the name of leafstripper which is also given to this moth indicates it way of living before it is transformed into the perfect insect the caterpillar gnaws the leaf of all fruittrees without distinction and even of other tree such a oak birch and linden for tree that have not been smeared with a tar girdle to stop the moth at laying time there is but one mode of defense left and that is not nearly so good a the first it is to shake the infested tree so a to make the caterpillar fall and then crush them i prefer the tar girdle said louis yes but it must be applied in time in the autumn when the moth are about to make their appearance another moth of this group sometimes called the winter moth ha fore wing of a grayish winecolor dotted with brown and striped crosswise in a darker shade the female is a little better favored than that of the one we have just been considering having wing of a sort but too rudimentary to admit of flying it may be seen running over the ground toward the end of autumn when cold weather is approaching it tardy appearance ha earned it the name of winter moth like the moth of the inchworm it climb tree to lay it egg but can be prevented by the use of tar on the trunk it egg hatch in the spring and the caterpillar are fullgrown by may they are generally blackish with white yellow or green stripe running lengthwise on leaving the egg these caterpillar bore the bud of pear apple apricot and other fruit tree later they install themselves one by one between two leaf the edge of which they unite with thread of silk chapter liii sapsucker what do plantlice eat asked jules one day i have never seen them feeding on leaf they do not feed on them his uncle replied they drink the sap through a very fine short pointed sucker which they carry against the breast when not in use the insect plunge it into the plant and for whole day without moving drink the sap at the point pricked when this place is sucked dry it pass to another but without much change of position the plantlouse is a sedentary creature to move around a stem no bigger than your little finger is for the louse a long journey fraught with peril not lightly to be faced a few step forward to make room in the rear for some fifty child a fast a they are brought into the world being about all that the boldest of these creature dare to undertake but plantlice of the last generation of the year have wing and lay egg which in the spring renew the race annihilated by the cold of winter these winged louse are no timid stayathomes like the others they gladly quit the natal leaf to see a bit of the world it is their business to travel hither and yon and lay their egg in many place so that in the following spring all plant shall have their share of louse and it is to fulfill this duty that they are expressly provided with wing cloud of these traveling plantlice dense enough to obscure the light of day have been observed many other insect have like the plantlouse a straight pointed sucker which they plunge into the substance they wish to drain of it juice and which they hold against the breast when not in use the cicada furnishes u a very good example a do also the large bug found on tree and on many plant the cabbage feed two of them the harlequin cabbagebug which is red with numerous black spot and still another cabbagebug of a bluishgreen color with white or red spot bug of this class have four wing the upper pair covering the other pair when in repose the forward half of each upper wing is hard like the beetle wing sheath but the other half is membranous and of fine texture this structure make them half sheath for protection and half wing for flying and it is because of this peculiarity that insect of this sort are called hemiptera or halfwinged creature the cicada is a halfwinged insect a is also the plantlouse although it upper wing i am speaking of winged plantlice of course instead of being one half hard and the other half of a more delicate texture have the same fineness and transparency throughout but the most striking characteristic of these insect and the one that determines their mode of life is the beak for sucking so we will call hemiptera all insect equipped with a pointed sucker which lie against the breast when in repose and we will not concern ourselves with the question of wing whether half or entirely membranous do the hemiptera form an order by themselves asked jules they form an order in the same way that coleoptera lepidoptera hymenoptera diptera and so on form each an order but hemiptera do not undergo so thorough a transformation a other insect being born with very nearly the form they will always have the chief change consists in the growing of wing which the insect doe not have at first but acquires later when it ha attained sufficient size in some specie several generation succeed one another before the winged state which is the perfect one is reached plantlice belong to this class the earlier generation of the year having no wing and only the last being equipped with them a hemipterous insect with habit somewhat like those of the plant louse cause considerable damage to peartrees it is commonly called the flealouse of the pear and is a small reddish insect with diaphanous wing that fold at an angle like the two side of an acuteangled roof it is found on peartrees and more rarely on appletrees toward the end of april the egg are laid one by one in slight gash made in the leafstem by the female with a little auger situated at the end of the abdomen the larvæ that come from these egg grow rapidly and differ from the perfect insect only in their lack of wing by sloughing the skin these larvæ become nymph short and stubby and already having on each side a rudimentary wing in it final form the insect acquires perfect wing in all three of it successive stage the insect plunge it sucker into the tender bark or into the leaf and suck the sap the best way to destroy these creature is to use a hard bristle brush on those part of the bark where they are to be found in multitude chapter liv queer musical instrument uncle paul had placed in the lettuce bed two large pot half full of water and set into the ground flush with the surface he said they were a trap for molecrickets which from the withered appearance of some of the plant he suspected were in the garden one morning on going to look into the pot emile found three drowned molecrickets in them that evening uncle paul told the child about these creature the insect emile found in the trap said he are called molecrickets from their habit of burrowing into the ground like mole and from their resembling in certain other way ordinary cricket the molecricket ha the common cricket long and slender antennæ it two flexible filament at the end of the abdomen and it rough wing which are rubbed against each other so a to make a sort of singing noise it is a formidable ravager of our garden do cricket really chirp with their wing asked emile in surprise yes my boy in chirping the cricket raise it wing which are dry and wrinkled and rub the edge together vigorously the other chirping insect do about the same the vineyard grasshopper the one with the large green and yellow belly ha on it back two round scale which fit together and rub against each other they constitute it musical instrument other grasshopper play the violin that is to say they scrape the rough edge of their wing with their big curved thigh a bow or fiddlestick the cicada ha under it stomach in a double cavity protected by cover capable of being raised more or le two dry and shiny membrane stretched a taut a drumhead the insect sings by making these vibrate in their case doe the molecricket say creecree like the ordinary cricket no it song ha a monotonous sound being a sort of sharp buzzing rather subdued and continuous and why doe the molecricket sing what an ugly creature with it little crafty eye short wing big stomach and frightful fore foot it sings to cheer it solitude and call it mate you think it ugly i find it admirably equipped for the work it ha to do it life in the ground just a mole do and like them it is provided with a special tool for digging in the earth and cutting the root that bar it way have you ever noticed a mole fore foot they are broadly shovelshaped and furnished with strong claw the molecrickets fore foot are very much like them being short and wide and edged with sawteeth with this pair of powerful tool the insect dig it subterranean tunnel then that said jules must be the reason for calling it a molecricket it ha the mole wide foot for digging i should like to know emile interposed what the mole and molecricket do under the ground they hunt for worm and all kind of insect for food in their subterranean operation both cut with their fore foot the root that obstruct their progress but the mole exclusively carnivorous doe not eat them whereas the molecricket living on both animal and vegetable matter nibble them at it pleasure nor doe it disdain a tender lettuce leaf when at night it come up above ground to get a little air and cultivate the acquaintance of it neighbor hence the molecricket doe a great deal of damage in garden by laying bare the root of young plant when it is boring it tunnel or by severing these root with the sawlike edge of it foot or by nibbling them when hungry not far beneath the surface of the ground the female make her nest which is in the form of a hollow ball of earth about a large a your fist in this cavity after it ha been carefully smoothed and prepared she lay her egg to the number of three or four hundred after which she remains in the neighborhood a if to watch over them when first hatched the young one are white all over and look like big ant when the ground is spaded these nest should always be destroyed the molecrickets domain is composed of passage running down to a greater or le distance with hunting gallery just under the surface to dislodge the insect from it retreat a little oil is poured into the hole where it is thought to have taken refuge and then plenty of water from the wateringpot until all the passage are inundated threatened with suffocation by the oil which interferes with it breathing the molecricket soon come to the surface one can also use the trap that i have found serviceable a wide and deep vessel is set into the ground level with the surface and half filled with water attracted by the coolness the molecrickets fall in and drown in the course of their nocturnal promenade sometimes again at the approach of cold weather hole are dug here and there and filled with horse manure the warmth of the manure is agreeable to the molecrickets and they come and hide in it for the winter when cold weather begin these lurkingplaces are searched and the foolish occupant destroyed the molecricket the housecricket the locust and the grasshopper belong to a family of insect called orthoptera so named from their straight wing that is the lower wing those used for flying are folded lengthwise in a straight line when in repose like a closed fan look at the red or blue wing of the cricket that abound in autumn in dry grass and you will see them neatly folded lengthwise while the upper wing which are somewhat leathery are usually brought together in the shape of a roof many but not all of the orthoptera have thick thigh ending in long and bristly leg that serve for jumping finally some of these insect have at the end of the abdomen a terebra commonly called a sword it office being to lay the egg in the ground one of these orthoptera commits terrible ravage in africa it is the migratory locust so named because it assembles in immense swarm and migrates to another region when food fails the migrating swarm take flight a at a given signal and move through the air like a great cloud even intercepting the light of the sun sooner or later the devastating horde swoop down like a living storm on the cultivated field of some province and in a few hour leaf grain pasture field all are browsed bare a if swept by a conflagration the ground showing not a green blade of any kind surviving if those ravenous locust travel like that said jules couldnt they come here driven by a favorable wind cloud of locust do sometimes cross the mediterranean and alight in our southern department at various time the territory of arles ha suffered this terrible visitation it should be added that if the country suit them where they chance to alight the locust lay their egg there and from these there spring a legion of devourer more numerous than the first to lessen the ravage of this second generation search is made for the egg which the locust lay in a cylindrical hole running a few centimeter into the ground in 1832 in the neighborhood of arles nearly four thousand kilogram of egg were gathered besides bagful of the insect themselves it take eighty thousand egg to make a kilogram hence in that harvest of egg there were three hundred and twenty million locust destroyed before they were born imagine the ravage of such a swarm of devourer alighting on the vegetation of any given district before so terrible a scourge man bow his head and acknowledges his powerlessness the insect ravager overwhelming him by it very number how many other ravagers there are my child besides locust that by their inconceivable multitude defy our attempt to defend ourselves you are now in a position to realize somewhat the serious nature of these devastation when you think of all the moth and caterpillar and worm all the creeping and burrowing and flying insect of all shape and size and appetite that attack our garden and field they would certainly gain the upper hand if we had to depend on ourselves in combating them but fortunately we are most ably assisted in this contest '"

              "'the pine processionary the egg and the hatching this caterpillar ha already had his story told by réaumur 1 but it wa a story marked by gap these were inevitable in the condition under which the great man worked for he had to receive all his material by barge from the distant bordeaux landes the transplanted insect could not be expected to furnish it biographer with other than fragmentary evidence very weak in those biological detail which form the principal charm of entomology to study the habit of insect one must observe them long and closely on their native heath so to speak in the place where their instinct have full and natural play with caterpillar foreign to the paris climate and brought from the other end of france réaumur therefore ran the risk of missing many most interesting fact this is what actually happened just a it did on a later occasion in the case of another alien the cicada 2 nevertheless the information which he wa able to extract from a few nest sent to him from the landes is of the highest value better served than he by circumstance i will take up afresh the story of the processionary caterpillar of the pine if the subject doe not come up to my hope it will certainly not be for lack of material in my harmas 3 laboratory now stocked with a few tree in addition to it bush stand some vigorous firtrees the aleppo pine and the black austrian pine a substitute for that of the landes every year the caterpillar take possession of them and spin his great purse in their branch in the interest of the leaf which are horribly ravaged a though there had been a fire i am obliged each winter to make a strict survey and to extirpate the nest with a long forked batten you voracious little creature if i let you have your way i should soon be robbed of the murmur of my once so leafy pine today i will seek compensation for all the trouble i have taken let u make a compact you have a story to tell tell it me and for a year for two year or longer until i know more or le all about it i shall leave you undisturbed even at the cost of lamentable suffering to the pine having concluded the treaty and left the caterpillar in peace i soon have abundant material for my observation in return for my indulgence i get some thirty nest within a few step of my door if the collection were not large enough the pinetrees in the neighbourhood would supply me with any necessary addition but i have a preference and a decided preference for the population of my own enclosure whose nocturnal habit are much easier to observe by lanternlight with such treasure daily before my eye at any time that i wish and under natural condition i can not fail to see the processionarys story unfolded at full length let u try and first of all the egg which réaumur did not see in the first fortnight of august let u inspect the lower branch of the pine on a level with our eye if we pay the least attention we soon discover here and there on the foliage certain little whitish cylinder spotting the dark green these are the bombyx egg each cylinder is the cluster laid by one mother the pineneedles are grouped in two each pair is wrapped at it base in a cylindrical muff which measure about an inch long by a fifth or sixth of an inch wide this muff which ha a silky appearance and is white slightly tinted with russet is covered with scale that overlap after the manner of the tile on a roof and yet their arrangement though fairly regular is by no mean geometrical the general aspect is more or le that of an immature walnutcatkin the scale are almost oval in form semitransparent and white with a touch of brown at the base and of russet at the tip they are free at the lower end which taper slightly but firmly fixed at the upper end which is wider and blunter you can not detach them either by blowing on them or by rubbing them repeatedly with a hairpencil they stand up like a fleece stroked the wrong way if the sheath is rubbed gently upwards and retain this bristling position indefinitely they resume their original arrangement when the friction is in the opposite direction at the same time they are a soft a velvet to the touch carefully laid one upon the other they form a roof that protects the egg it is impossible for a drop of rain or dew to penetrate under this shelter of soft tile the origin of this defensive covering is selfevident the mother ha stripped a part of her body to protect her egg like the eiderduck she ha made a warm overcoat for them out of her own down réaumur had already suspected a much from a very curious peculiarity of the moth let me quote the passage the female he say have a shiny patch on the upper part of their body near the hindquarter the shape and gloss of this disk attracted my attention the first time that i saw it i wa holding a pin with which i touched it to examine it structure the contact of the pin produced a little spectacle that surprised me i saw a cloud of tiny spangle at once detach themselves these spangle scattered in every direction some seemed to be shot into the air others to the side but the greater part of the cloud fell softly to the ground each of those body which i am calling spangle is an extremely slender lamina bearing some resemblance to the atom of dust on the moth wing but of course much bigger the disk that is so noticeable on the hindquarter of these moth is therefore a heapand an enormous heapof these scale the female seem to use them to wrap their egg in but the moth of the pine caterpillar refused to lay while in my charge and consequently did not enlighten me a to whether they use the scale to cover their egg or a to what they are doing with all those scale gathered round their hinder part which were not given them and placed in that position to serve no purpose you were right my learned master that dense and regular crop of spangle did not grow on the moth tail for nothing is there anything that ha no object you did not think so i do not think so either everything ha it reason for existing yes you were wellinspired when you foresaw that the cloud of scale which flew out under the point of your pin must serve to protect the egg i remove the scaly fleece with my pincer and a i expected the egg appear looking like little whiteenamel bead clustering closely together they make nine longitudinal row in one of these row i count thirtyfive egg a the nine row are very nearly alike the content of the cylinder amount in all to about three hundred egg a respectable family for one mother the egg of one row or file alternate exactly with those in the two adjoining file so a to leave no empty space they suggest a piece of beadwork produced with exquisite dexterity by patient finger it would be more correct still to compare them with a cob of indian corn with it neat row of seed but a greatly reduced cob the tininess of whose dimension make it mathematical precision all the more remarkable the grain of the moth spike have a slight tendency to be hexagonal because of their mutual pressure they are stuck close together so much so that they can not be separated if force is used the layer come off the leaf in fragment in small cake always consisting of several egg apiece the bead laid are therefore fastened together by a glutinous varnish and it is on this varnish that the broad base of the defensive scale is fixed it would be interesting if a favourable opportunity occurred to see how the mother achieves that beautifully regular arrangement of the egg and also how a soon a she ha laid one all sticky with varnish she make a roof for it with a few scale removed one by one from her hindquarter for the moment the very structure of the finished work tell u the course of the procedure it is evident that the egg are not laid in longitudinal file but in circular row in ring which lie one above the other alternating their grain the laying begin at the bottom near the lower end of the double pineleaf it finish at the top the first egg in order of date are those of the bottom ring the last are those of the top ring the arrangement of the scale all in a longitudinal direction and attached by the end facing the top of the leaf make any other method of progression inadmissible let u consider in the light of reflection the elegant edifice now before our eye young or old cultured or ignorant we shall all on seeing the bombyx pretty little spike exclaim how handsome and what will strike u most will be not the beautiful enamel pearl but the way in which they are put together with such geometrical regularity whence we can draw a great moral to wit that an exquisite order governs the work of a creature without consciousness one of the humblest of the humble a paltry moth follows the harmonious law of order if micromégas 4 took it into his head to leave sirius once more and visit our planet would he find anything to admire among u voltaire show him to u using one of the diamond of his necklace a a magnifyingglass in order to obtain some sort of view of the threemaster which ha run aground on his thumbnail he enters into conversation with the crew a nailparing curved like a horn encompasses the ship and serf a a speakingtrumpet a toothpick which touch the vessel with it tapering end and the lip of the giant some thousand fathom above with the other serf a a telephone the outcome of the famous dialogue is that if we would form a sound judgment of thing and see them under fresh aspect there is nothing like changing one planet the probability then is that the sirian would have had a rather poor notion of our artistic beauty to him our masterpiece of statuary even though sprung from the chisel of a phidias would be mere doll of marble or bronze hardly more worthy of interest than the childrens rubber doll are to u our landscapepaintings would be regarded a dish of spinach smelling unpleasantly of oil our operascores would be described a very expensive noise these thing belonging to the domain of the sens posse a relative æsthetic value subordinated to the organism that judge them certainly the venus of melos and the apollo belvedere are superb work but even so it take a special eye to appreciate them micromégas if he saw them would be full of pity for the leanness of human form to him the beautiful call for something other than our sorry froglike anatomy show him on the other hand that sort of abortive windmill by mean of which pythagoras echoing the wise men of egypt teach u the fundamental property of the rightangled triangle should the good giant contrary to our expectation happen not to know about it explain to him what the windmill mean once the light ha entered his mind he will find just a we do that there is beauty there real beauty not certainly in that horrible hieroglyphic the figure but in the unchangeable relation between the length of the three side he will admire a much a we do geometry the eternal balancer of space there is therefore a severe beauty belonging to the domain of reason the same in every world the same under every sun whether the sun be single or many white or red blue or yellow this universal beauty is order everything is done by weight and measure a great statement whose truth break upon u all the more vividly a we probe more deeply into the mystery of thing is this order upon which the equilibrium of the universe is based the predestined result of a blind mechanism doe it enter into the plan of an eternal geometer a plato had it is it the ideal of a supreme lover of beauty which would explain everything why all this regularity in the curve of the petal of a flower why all this elegance in the chasings on a beetle wingcases is that infinite grace even in the tiniest detail compatible with the brutality of uncontrolled force one might a well attribute the artist exquisite medallion to the steamhammer which make the slag sweat in the melting these are very lofty thought concerning a miserable cylinder which will bear a crop of caterpillar it can not be helped the moment one try to dig out the least detail of thing up start a why which scientific investigation is unable to answer the riddle of the world ha certainly it explanation otherwhere than in the little truth of our laboratory but let u leave micromégas to philosophize and return to the commonplace of observation the pine bombyx ha rival in the art of gracefully grouping her eggbeads among their number is the neustrian bombyx whose caterpillar is known by the name of livery because of his costume her egg are assembled in bracelet around little branch varying greatly in nature apple and pearbranches chiefly any one seeing this elegant work for the first time would be ready to attribute it to the finger of a skilled stringer of bead my small son paul open eye wide with surprise and utters an astonished oh each time that he come upon the dear little bracelet the beauty of order force itself upon his dawning attention though not so long and marked above all by the absence of any wrapper the ring of the neustrian bombyx reminds one of the others cylinder stripped of it scaly covering it would be easy to multiply these instance of elegant grouping contrived now in one way now in another but always with consummate art it would take up too much time however let u keep to the pine bombyx the hatching take place in september a little earlier in one case a little later in another so that i may easily watch the newborn caterpillar in their first labour i have placed a few eggladen branch in the window of my study they are standing in a glass of water which will keep them properly fresh for some time the little caterpillar leave the egg in the morning at about eight oclock if i just lift the scale of the cylinder in process of hatching i see black head appear which nibble and burst and push back the torn ceiling the tiny creature emerge slowly some here and some there all over the surface after the hatching the scaly cylinder is a regular and a fresh in appearance a if it were still inhabited we do not perceive that it is deserted until we raise the spangle the egg still arranged in regular row are now so many yawning goblet of a slightly translucent white they lack the capshaped lid which ha been rent and destroyed by the newborn grub the puny creature measure a millimetre 5 at most in length devoid a yet of the bright red that will soon be their adornment they are paleyellow bristling with hair some shortish and black others rather longer and white the head of a glossy black is big in proportion it diameter is twice that of the body this exaggerated size of the head implies a corresponding strength of jaw capable of attacking tough food from the start a huge head stoutly clad in horn is the predominant feature of the budding caterpillar these macrocephalous one are a we see wellarmed against the hardness of the pineneedles so wellarmed in fact that the meal begin almost immediately after roaming for a few moment at random among the scale of the common cradle most of the young caterpillar make for the double leaf that served a an axis for the native cylinder and spread themselves over it at length others go to the adjacent leaf here a well a there they fall to and the gnawed leaf is hollowed into faint and very narrow groove bounded by the vein which are left intact from time to time three or four who have eaten their fill fall into line and walk in step but soon separate each going his own way this is practice for the coming procession if i disturb them ever so little they sway the front half of their body and wag their head with a jerky movement similar to the action of an intermittent spring but the sun reach the corner of the window where the careful rearing is in progress then sufficiently refreshed the little family retreat to it native soil the base of the double leaf gather into an irregular group and begin to spin it work is a gauze globule of extreme delicacy supported on some of the neighbouring leaf under this tent a very widemeshed net a siesta is taken during the hottest and brightest part of the day in the afternoon when the sun ha gone from the window the flock leaf it shelter disperses around sometimes forming a little procession within a radius of an inch and start browsing again thus the very moment of hatching proclaims talent which age will develop without adding to their number in le than an hour from the bursting of the egg the caterpillar is both a processionary and a spinner he also flees the light when taking refreshment we shall soon find him visiting his grazinggrounds only at night the spinner is very feeble but so active that in twentyfour hour the silken globe attains the bulk of a hazelnut and in a couple of week that of an apple nevertheless it is not the nucleus of the great establishment in which the winter is to be spent it is a provisional shelter very light and inexpensive in material the mildness of the season make anything else unnecessary the young caterpillar freely gnaw the log the pole between which the thread are stretched that is to say the leaf contained within the silken tent their house supply them at the same time with board and lodging this excellent arrangement save them from having to go out a dangerous proceeding at their age for these puny one the hammock is also the larder nibbled down to their vein the supporting leaf wither and easily come unfastened from the branch and the silken globe becomes a hovel that crumbles with the first gust of wind the family then move on and go elsewhere to erect a new tent lasting no longer than the first even so doe the arab move on a the pasture around his camelhide dwelling become exhausted these temporary establishment are renewed several time over always at greater height than the last so much so that the tribe which wa hatched on the lower branch trailing on the ground gradually reach the higher bough and sometimes the very summit of the pinetree in a few week time a first moult replaces the humble fleece of the start which is palecoloured shaggy and ugly by another which lack neither richness nor elegance on the dorsal surface the various segment excepting the first three are adorned with a mosaic of six little bare patch of a bright red which stand out a little above the dark background of the skin two the largest are in front two behind and one almost dotshaped on either side of the quadrilateral the whole is surrounded by a palisade of scarlet bristle divergent and lying almost flat the other hair those of the belly and side are longer and whitish in the centre of this crimson marquetry stand two cluster of very short bristle gathered into flattened tuft which gleam in the sun like speck of gold the length of the caterpillar is now about two centimetre 6 and his width three or four millimetre 7 such is the costume of middle age which like the earlier one wa unknown to réaumur the pine processionary the nest the community november arrives however bringing cold weather the time ha come to build the stout winter tabernacle high up in the pine the tip of a bough is chosen with suitably closepacked and convergent leaf the spinner surround it with a spreading network which bend the adjacent leaf a little nearer and end by incorporating them into the fabric in this way they obtain an enclosure half silk half leaf capable of withstanding the inclemency of the weather early in december the work ha increased to the size of a man two fist or more in it ultimate perfection it attains a volume of nearly half a gallon by the end of winter it is roughly eggshaped tapering to a certain length below and extended into a sheath which envelops the supporting branch the origin of this silky extension is a follows every evening between seven and nine oclock weather permitting the caterpillar leave the nest and go down the bare part of the bough which form the pole of the tent the road is broad for this axis is sometimes a wide a the neck of a claretbottle the descent is accomplished without any attempt at order and always slowly so much so that the first caterpillar to come out have not yet dispersed before they are caught up by the others the branch is thus covered by a continuous bark of caterpillar made up of the whole community which gradually divide into squad and disperses to this side and that on the nearest branch to crop their leaf now not one of the caterpillar move a step without working his spinneret therefore the broad downward path which on the way back will be the ascending path is covered a the result of constant traffic with a multitude of thread forming an unbroken sheath it is obvious that this sheath in which each caterpillar passing backwards and forward on his nocturnal ramble leaf a double thread is not an indicator laid down with the sole object of simplifying the journey back to the nest a mere ribbon would be enough for that it use might well be to strengthen the edifice to give it deeper foundation and to join it by a multitude of cable to the steady branch the whole thing thus consists above of the home distended into an ovoid and below of the stalk the sheath surrounding the support and adding it resistance to that of the numerous other fastening each nest that ha not yet had it shape altered by the prolonged residence of the caterpillar show in the centre a bulky milkwhite shell with around it a wrapper of diaphanous gauze the central mass formed of thicklywoven thread ha for a wall a thick quilt into which are absorbed a support number of leaf green and intact the thickness of this wall may be anything up to threequarters of an inch at the top of the dome are round opening varying greatly in number and distribution a wide across a an ordinary leadpencil these are the door of the house through which the caterpillar go in and out all around the shell are projecting leaf which the insect teeth have respected from the tip of each leaf there radiate in graceful undulating curve thread which loosely interlaced form a light tent a spacious verandah of careful workmanship especially in the upper part here we find a broad terrace on which in the daytime the caterpillar come and doze in the sun heaped one upon the other with rounded back the network stretching overhead doe duty a an awning it moderate the heat of the sun ray it also save the sleeper from a fall when the bough rock in the wind let u take our scissors and rip open the nest from end to end longitudinally a wide window open and allows u to see the arrangement of the inside the first thing to strike u is that the leaf contained in the enclosure are intact and quite sound the young caterpillar in their temporary establishment gnaw the leaf within the silken wrapper to death they thus have their larder stocked for a few day without having to quit their shelter in bad weather a condition made necessary by their weakness when they grow stronger and start working on their winter home they are very careful not to touch the leaf why these new scruple the reason is evident if bruised those leaf the framework of the house would very soon wither and then be blown off with the first breath of wind the silken purse torn from it base would collapse on the other hand if the leaf are respected they remain vigorous and furnish a stout support against the assault of winter a solid fastening is superfluous for the summer tent which last but a day it is indispensable to the permanent shelter which will have to bear the burden of heavy snow and the buffeting of icy wind fully alive to these peril the spinner of the pinetree considers himself bound however importunate his hunger not to saw through the rafter of his house inside the nest therefore opened by my scissors i see a thick arcade of green leaf more or le closely wrapped in a silky sheath whence dangle shred of cast skin and string of dried droppings in short this interior is an extremely unpleasant place a ragshop and a sewagefarm in one and corresponds in no way with the imposing exterior all around is a solid wall of quilting and of closelywoven leaf there are no chamber no compartment marked off by partitionwalls it is a single room turned into a labyrinth by the colonnade of green leaf placed in row one above the other throughout the oval hall here the caterpillar stay when resting gathered on the column heaped in confused mass when we remove the hopeless tangle at the top we see the light filtering in at certain point of the roof these luminous point correspond with the opening that communicate with the outer air the network that form a wrapper to the nest ha no special exit to pas through it in either direction the caterpillar have only to push the sparse thread aside slightly the inner wall a compact rampart ha it door the flimsy outer veil ha none it is in the morning at about ten oclock that the caterpillar leave their nightapartment and come to take the sun on their terrace under the awning which the point of the leaf hold up at a distance they spend the whole day there dozing motionless heaped together they steep themselves deliciously in warmth and from time to time betray their bliss by nodding and wagging their head at six or seven oclock when it grows dark the sleeper awake bestir themselves separate and go their several way over the surface of the nest we now behold an indeed delightful spectacle brightred stripe meander in every direction over the white sheet of silk one go up another come down a third move aslant others form a short procession and a they solemnly walk about in a splendid disorder each glue to the ground which it cover the thread that constantly hang from it lip thus is the thickness of the shelter increased by a fine layer added immediately above the previous structure thus is the dwelling strengthened by fresh support the adjoining green leaf are taken into the network and absorbed in the building if the tiniest bit of them remains free curve radiate from that point increasing the size of the veil and fastening it at a greater distance every evening therefore for an hour or two great animation reign on the surface of the nest if the weather permit and the work of consolidating and thickening the structure is carried on with indefatigable zeal do they foresee the future these wary one who take such precaution against the rigour of winter obviously not their few month experienceif indeed experience can be mentioned in connection with a caterpillartells them of savoury bellyful of green stuff of gentle slumber in the sun on the terrace of the nest but nothing hitherto ha made them acquainted with cold steady rain with frost snow and furious blast of wind and these creature knowing naught of winter woe take the same precaution a if they were thoroughly aware of all that the inclement season hold in store for them they work away at their house with an ardour that seems to say oh how nice and warm we shall be in our bed here nestling one against the other when the pinetree swing aloft it frosted candelabra let u work with a will laboremus yes caterpillar my friend let u work with a will great and small men and grub alike so that we may fall asleep peacefully you with the torpor that make way for your transformation into moth we with that last sleep which break off life only to renew it laboremus anxious to watch my caterpillar habit in detail without having to sally forth by lanternlight often in bad weather to see what happens in the pinetrees at the end of the enclosure i have installed halfadozen nest in a greenhouse a modest glazed shelter which though hardly any warmer than the air outside at least affords protection from the wind and rain fixed in the sand at a height of about eighteen inch by the base of the bough that serf a both an axis and a framework each nest receives for ration a bundle of little pinebranches which are renewed a soon a they are consumed i take my lantern every evening and pay my boarder a visit this is the way in which most of my fact are obtained after the day work come the evening meal the caterpillar descend from the nest adding a few more thread to the silvery sheath of the support and reach the posy of fresh green stuff which is lying quite near it is a magnificent sight to see the redcoated band lined up in two and three on each needle and in rank so closely formed that the green sprig of the bunch bend under the load the diner all motionless all poking their head forward nibble in silence placidly their broad black forehead gleam in the ray of the lantern a shower of granule drop on the sand below these are the residue of easygoing stomach only too ready to digest their food by tomorrow morning the soil will have disappeared under a greenish layer of this intestinal hail yes indeed it is a sight to see one far more stimulating than that of the silkworm messroom young and old we are all so much interested in it that our evening almost invariably end in a visit to the greenhouse caterpillar the meal is prolonged far into the night satisfied at last some sooner some later they go back to the nest where for a little longer feeling their silkglands filled they continue spinning on the surface these hard worker would scruple to cross the white carpet without contributing a few thread it is getting on for one or even two oclock in the morning when the last of the band go indoors my duty a a fosterfather is daily to renew the bunch of sprig which are shorn to the last leaf on the other hand my duty a an historian is to enquire to what extent the diet can be varied the district supply me with processionaries on the scotch pine the maritime pine and the aleppo pine indifferently but never on the other coniferæ yet one would think that any resinscented leaf ought to suit so say chemical analysis we must mistrust the chemist retort when it poke it nose into the kitchen it may succeed in making butter out of tallowcandles and brandy out of potato but when it tell u that the product are identical we shall do well to refuse these abomination science astonishingly rich a it is in poison will never provide u with anything fit to eat because though the raw substance fall to a large extent within it domain that same substance escape it method the moment that it is wanted organized divided and subdivided indefinitely by the process of life a needed by the stomach whose requirement are not to be met by measured dos of our reagent the raw material of cell and fibre may perhaps be artificially obtained some day cell and fibre themselves never there the rub with your chemical feeding the caterpillar loudly proclaim the insurmountable difficulty of the problem relying on my chemical data i offer them the different substitute for the pine growing in my enclosure the spruce the yew the thuja the juniper the cypress what am i asking them pine caterpillar to bite into that they will take good care not to despite the tempting resinous smell they would die of hunger rather than touch it one conifer and one only is excepted the cedar my charge browse upon it leaf with no appreciable repugnance why the cedar and not the others i do not know the caterpillar stomach fastidious a our own ha it secret let u pas to other test i have just slit open longitudinally a nest whose internal structure i want to explore owing to the natural shrinkage of the split swansdown the cleft reach two finger breadth in the centre and taper at the top and bottom what will the spinner do in the presence of such a disaster the operation is performed by day while the caterpillar are slumbering in heap upon the dome a the livingroom is deserted at this time i can cut boldly with the scissors without risk of damaging any part of the population my ravage do not wake the sleeper all day long not one appears upon the breach this indifference look a though it were due to the fact that the danger is not yet known thing will be different tonight when the busy work begin again however dull they may be the caterpillar will certainly notice that huge window which freely admits the deadly draught of winter and possessing any amount of padding they will crowd round the dangerous gap and stop it up in a trice thus do we argue forgetting the animal intellectual darkness what really happens is that when night fall the indifference of the caterpillar remains a great a ever the breach in the tent provokes not a sign of excitement they move to and fro on the surface of the nest they work they spin a usual there is no change absolutely none in their behaviour when the road covered chance to bring some of them to the brink of the ravine we see no alacrity on their part no sign of anxiety no attempt to close up the two edge of the slit they simply strive to accomplish the difficult crossing and to continue their stroll a though they were walking on a perfect web and they manage it somehow or other by fixing the thread a far a the length of their body permit having once crossed the gulf they pursue their way imperturbably without stopping any more at the breach others come upon the scene and using the thread already laid a footbridge pas over the rent and walk on leaving their own thread a they go thus the first night work result in the laying over the cleft of a filmy gauze hardly perceptible but just sufficient for the traffic of the colony the same thing is repeated on the night that follow and the crevice end by being closed with a scanty sort of spider web and that is all there is no improvement by the end of the winter the window made by my scissors is still wide open though thinly veiled it black spindle shape show from the top of the nest to the bottom there is no darn in the split texture no piece of swansdown let in between the two edge to restore the roof to it original state if the accident had happened in the open air and not under glass the foolish spinner would probably have died of cold in their cracked house twice renewed with the same result this test prof that the pine caterpillar are not alive to the danger of their split dwelling expert spinner though they be they seem a unconscious of the ruin of their work a the spool in a factory are of a broken thread they could easily make good the damage by stopping up the breach with the silk that is lavished elsewhere without urgent need they could weave upon it a material a thick and solid a the rest of the wall but no they placidly continue their habitual task they spin a they spun yesterday and a they will spin tomorrow strengthening the part that are already strong thickening what is already thick enough and not one think of stopping the disastrous gap to let a piece into that hole would mean weaving the tent all over again from the beginning and no insect however industrious go back to what it ha already done i have often called attention to this feature in animal psychology notably i have described the ineptitude of the caterpillar of the great peacock moth 8 when the experimenter lops the top off the complicated eeltrap which form the pointed end of the cocoon this caterpillar spends the silk remaining to him in work of secondary importance instead of making good the series of cone each fitting into the other which are so essential to the hermit protection he continues his normal task imperturbably a though nothing out of the way had taken place even so doe the spinner in the pinetree act with his burst tent your fosterparent must perpetrate yet another piece of mischief o my processionary but this time it shall be to your advantage it doe not take me long to perceive that the nest intended to last through the winter often contain a population much greater than that of the temporary shelter woven by the very young caterpillar i also notice that when they have attained their ultimate dimension these nest differ very considerably in size the largest of them are equal to five or six of the smallest what is the cause of these variation certainly if all the egg turned out well the scaly cylinder containing the laying of a single mother would be enough to fill a splendid purse there are three hundred enamelled bead here for hatching but in family which swarm unduly an enormous waste always take place and restores the balance of thing if the called are legion the chosen are a well thinnedout troop a is proved by the cicada the praying mantis 9 and the cricket the pine processionary another crucible of organic matter of which various devourer take advantage is also reduced in number immediately after the hatching the delicate mouthful ha shrunk to a few dozen of survivor around the light globular network in which the family pass the sunny autumn day soon they will have to be thinking of the stoutlybuilt winter tent at such a time it would be a boon if they could be many for from union spring strength i suspect an easy method of fusion among a few family to serve them a a guide in their peregrination about the tree the caterpillar have their silk ribbon which they follow on their return after describing a bend they may also miss it and strike another one differing in no respect from their own this new ribbon mark the way to some nest situated in the neighbourhood the strayed caterpillar failing to distinguish it from their own ribbon follow it conscientiously and in this manner end by reaching a strange dwelling suppose them to be peacefully received what will happen once fused the several group assembled by the accident of the path will form a powerful city fitted to produce great work the concerted weakling will give rise to a strong united body this would explain the thicklypopulated bulky nest situated so near to others that have remained puny the former would be the work of a syndicate incorporating the interest of spinner collected from different part the latter would belong to family left in isolation by the luck of the road it remains to be seen whether the chancecomers guided by a strange ribbon meet with a good reception in the new abode the experiment is easily made upon the nest in the greenhouse in the evening at the hour devoted to grazing i remove with a pruningshears the different little branch covered with the population of one nest and lay them on the provision of the neighbouring nest which provision are also overrun with caterpillar or i can make shorter work of it by taking the whole bunch well covered with the troop of the first pouch and planting it right beside the bunch of the second so that the leaf of the two mingle a little at the edge there is not the least quarrelling between the real proprietor and the new arrival both go on peacefully browsing a though nothing had happened and all without hesitation when bedtime come make for the nest like brother who have always lived together all do some spinning before retiring to rest thicken the blanket a little and are then swallowed up in the dormitory by repeating the same operation next day and if necessary the day after in order to collect the laggard i succeed without the slightest difficulty in wholly depopulating the first nest and transferring all it caterpillar to the second i venture to do something better still the same method of transportation allows me to quadruple the output of a spinningmill by adding to it the worker of three similar establishment and if i limit myself to this increase the reason is not that any confusion manifest itself in this shifting of quarter but that i see no bound to my experiment so cheerfully do the caterpillar accept any addition to their number the more spinner the more spinning a very judicious rule of conduct let u add that the caterpillar which have been transported cherish no regret for their old house they are quite at home with the others and make no attempt to regain the nest whence they were banished by my artifice it is not the distance that discourages them for the empty dwelling is only half a yard away at most if for the purpose of my study i wish to restock the deserted nest i am obliged once more to resort to transportation which invariably prof successful later in february when an occasional fine day allows of long procession on the wall and the sandcovered shelf of the greenhouse i am able to watch the fusing of two group without personally intervening all that i have to do is patiently to follow the evolution of a file on the march i see it sometimes after leaving one nest enter a different one guided by some fortuitous change of route thenceforward the stranger form part of the community on the same footing a the others in a like fashion when the caterpillar walk abroad upon the tree at night the scanty group of the outset must increase and gather the number of spinner which an extensive building requires everything for everybody so say the pine processionary nibbling his leaf without quarrelling in the least over his neighbour mouthful or else enteringand being always peacefully receivedanothers home precisely a he would his own whether a member of the tribe or a stranger he find room in the refectory and room in the dormitory the others nest is his nest the others grazingground is his grazingground in which he is entitled to his fair share one neither greater nor smaller than the share of his habitual or casual companion each for all and all for each so say the processionary who every evening spends his little capital of silk on enlarging a shelter that is often new to him what would he do with his puny skein if alone hardly anything but there are hundred and hundred of them in the spinningmill and the result of their infinitesimal contribution woven into a common stuff is a thick blanket capable of resisting the winter in working for himself each work for the others and these on their side work a zealously for each o lucky animal that know nothing of property the mother of strife o enviable cenobite who practise the strictest communism these habit of the caterpillar invite a few reflection generous mind richer in illusion than in logic set communism before u a the sovran cure for human ill is it practicable among mankind at all time there have been there still are and there always will be fortunately association in which it is possible to forget in common some small part of the hardship of life but is it possible to generalize the caterpillar of the pine can give u much valuable information in this respect let u have no false shame our material need are shared by the animal they struggle a we do to take part in the general banquet of the living and the manner in which they solve the problem of existence is not to be despised let u then ask ourselves what are the reason that cause cenobitism to flourish among the processionaries one answer suggests itself inevitably to begin with the food problem that terrible disturber of the world tranquillity is here nonexistent peace reign a soon a the stomach is certain of being filled without a struggle a pineneedle or even le suffices for the caterpillar meal and that needle is always there waiting to be eaten is there in inexhaustible number almost on the threshold of the home when dinnertime arrives we caterpillar go out we take the air we walk a little in procession then without laborious seeking without jealous rivalry we seat ourselves at the banquet the table is plentifully spread and will never be bare so large and generous is the pine all that we need do is from one evening to the next to move our diningroom a little farther on consequently there are no present and no future care on the subject of provision the caterpillar find food to eat almost a easily a he find air to breathe the atmosphere feed all creature on air with a bounty which it is not necessary to crave all unknown to itself without the agency of any effort or labour the animal receives it share of the most vital of element the niggardly earth on the contrary surrender it gift only when laboriously forced not fruitful enough to satisfy every need it leaf the division of the food to the fierce eagerness of competition the mouthful to be procured engenders war between consumer look at two groundbeetles coming at the same time upon a bit of earthworm which of the two shall have the morsel the matter shall be decided by battle desperate ferocious battle with these famished one who eat at long interval and do not always eat their fill communal life is out of the question the pine caterpillar is free from these woe he find the earth a generous a the atmosphere he find eating a easy a breathing other instance of perfect communism might be named all occur among specie living on a vegetable diet provided however that victual are plentiful and obtainable without a hard search an animal diet on the contrary a prey always more or le difficult to secure banishes cenobitism where the portion is too small for one what excuse would there be for guest the pine processionary know nothing of privation he know a little of family tie another source of unrelenting competition to make ourselves a place in the sun is but a half of the struggle imposed upon u by life we must also a far a possible prepare a place for our successor and a the preservation of the specie is of greater importance than that of the individual the struggle for the future is even fiercer than the struggle for the present every mother regard the welfare of her offspring a her primary law perish all else provided that the brood flourish every one for himself is her maxim imposed by the rigour of the general conflict every one for himself is her rule the safeguard of the future with maternity and it imperious duty communism cease to be practicable at first sight certain hymenoptera 10 seem to declare the contrary we find for instance the masonbees of the shed 11 nesting in myriad on the same tile and building a monumental edifice at which all the mother work is this really a community not at all it is a city in which the inhabitant have neighbour not collaborator each mother kneads her pot of honey each amasses a dowry for her offspring and nothing but a dowry for her offspring each wear herself out for her family and only for her family oh it would be a serious business if some one merely came and alighted on the brim of a cell that did not belong to her the mistress of the house would give her to understand by mean of a sound drubbing that manner such a those are not to be endured she would have to skedaddle very quickly unless she wanted a fight the right of property are sacred here even the much more social hivebee is no exception to the rule of maternal egoism to each hive one mother if there be two civil war break out and one of them perishes by the others dagger or else quits the country followed by a part of the swarm although virtually fit to lay egg the other bee to the number of some twenty thousand renounce maternity and vow themselves to celibacy in order to bring up the prodigious family of the one and only mother here communism reign under certain aspect but for the immense majority motherhood is forthwith abolished even so with the wasp the ant the termite 12 and the various social insect life in common cost them dear thousand and thousand remain incomplete and become the humble auxiliary of a few who are sexually endowed but whenever maternity is the general portion individualism reappears a among the masonbees notwithstanding their show of communism the pine caterpillar are exempt from the duty of preserving the race they have no sex or rather are obscurely preparing one a undecided and rudimentary a all that is not yet but must one day be with the blossoming of maternity that flower of adult age individual property will not fail to appear attended by it rivalry the insect now so peaceable will like the others have it display of selfish intolerance the mother will isolate themselves jealous of the double pineneedle in which the cylinder of egg is to be fixed the male fluttering their wing will challenge one another for the possession of the coveted bride it is not a serious struggle among these easygoing one but still it present a faint picture of those mortal affray which the mating so often produce love rule the world by battle it too is a hotbed of competition the caterpillar being almost sexless is indifferent to amorous instinct this is the first condition for living pacifically in common but it is not enough the perfect concord of the community demand among all it member an equal division of strength and talent of taste and capacity for work this condition which perhaps is the most important of all is fulfilled preeminently if there were hundred if there were thousand of them in the same nest there would be no difference between any of them they are all the same size and equally strong all wear the same dress all posse the same gift for spinning and all with equal zeal expend the content of their silkglands for the general welfare no one idle no one lounge along when there is work to be done with no other stimulus than the satisfaction of doing their duty every evening when the weather is favourable they all spin with equal industry and drain to the last drop their reservoir of silk which have become distended during the day in their tribe there is no question of skilled or unskilled of strong or weak of abstemious or gluttonous there are neither hardworkers nor idler neither saver nor spendthrift what one doe the others do with a like zeal no more and no le well it is a splendid world of equality truly but ala a world of caterpillar if it suited u to go to school to the pine processionary we should soon see the inanity of our levelling and communistic theory equality is a magnificent political catchword but little more where is it this equality of ours in our social group could we find a many a two person exactly equal in strength health intelligence capacity for work foresight and all the other gift which are the great factor of prosperity where should we find anything analogous to the exact parity prevailing among caterpillar nowhere inequality is our law and a good thing too a sound which is invariably the same however often multiplied doe not constitute a harmony we need dissimilarity sound loud and soft deep and shrill we need even discord which by their harshness throw into relief the sweetness of the chord in the same way human society are harmonious only with the aid of contrary if the dream of our leveller could be realized we should sink to the monotony of the caterpillar society art science progress and the lofty flight of the imagination would slumber indefinitely in the dead calm of mediocrity besides if this general levelling were effected we should still be very far from communism to achieve that we should have to do away with the family a the caterpillar and plato teach u we should need abundance of food obtained without any effort so long a a mouthful of bread is difficult to acquire demanding an industry and labour of which we are not all equally capable so long a the family remains the sacred reason for our foresight so long will the generous theory of all for each and each for all be absolutely impracticable and then should we gain by abolishing the struggle for the daily bread of ourselves and those dependent on u it is very doubtful we should be getting rid of this world two great joy work and the family the only joy that give any value to life we should be stifling exactly that which make our greatness and the result of this bestial sacrilege would be a community of human caterpillar thus doe the pine processionary teach u by his example the pine processionary the procession drover dingdongs sheep followed the ram which panurge had maliciously thrown overboard and leapt nimbly into the sea one after the other for you know say rabelais it is the nature of the sheep always to follow the first wheresoever it go which make aristotle mark them for the most silly and foolish animal in the world 13 the pine caterpillar is even more sheeplike not from foolishness but from necessity where the first go all the others go in a regular string with not an empty space between them they proceed in single file in a continuous row each touching with it head the rear of the one in front of it the complex twist and turn described in his vagary by the caterpillar leading the van are scrupulously described by all the others no greek theoria winding it way to the eleusinian festival wa ever more orderly hence the name of processionary given to the gnawer of the pine his character is complete when we add that he is a ropedancer all his life long he walk only on the tightrope a silken rail placed in position a he advance the caterpillar who chance to be at the head of the procession dribble his thread without ceasing and fix it on the path which his fickle preference cause him to take the thread is so tiny that the eye though armed with a magnifyingglass suspect it rather than see it but a second caterpillar step on the slender footboard and double it with his thread a third treble it and all the others however many there be add the sticky spray from their spinnerets so much so that when the procession ha marched by there remains a a record of it passing a narrow white ribbon whose dazzling whiteness shimmer in the sun very much more sumptuous than ours their system of roadmaking consists in upholstering with silk instead of macadamizing we sprinkle our road with broken stone and level them by the pressure of a heavy steamroller they lay over their path a soft satin rail a work of general interest to which each contributes his thread what is the use of all this luxury could they not like other caterpillar walk about without these costly preparation i see two reason for their mode of progression it is night when the processionaries sally forth to browse upon the pineleaves they leave their nest situated at the top of a bough in profound darkness they go down the denuded pole till they come to the nearest branch that ha not yet been gnawed a branch which becomes lower and lower by degree a the consumer finish stripping the upper storey they climb up this untouched branch and spread over the green needle when they have had their supper and begin to feel the keen night air the next thing is to return to the shelter of the house measured in a straight line the distance is not great hardly an arm length but it can not be covered in this way on foot the caterpillar have to climb down from one crossing to the next from the needle to the twig from the twig to the branch from the branch to the bough and from the bough by a no le angular path to go back home it is useless to rely upon sight a a guide on this long and erratic journey the processionary it is true ha five ocular speck on either side of his head but they are so infinitesimal so difficult to make out through the magnifyingglass that we can not attribute to them any great power of vision besides what good would those shortsighted lens be in the absence of light in black darkness it is equally useless to think of the sense of smell ha the processional any olfactory power or ha he not i do not know without giving a positive answer to the question i can at least declare that his sense of smell is exceedingly dull and in no way suited to help him find his way this is proved in my experiment by a number of hungry caterpillar that after a long fast pas close beside a pinebranch without betraying any eagerness or showing a sign of stopping it is the sense of touch that tell them where they are so long a their lip do not chance to light upon the pastureland not one of them settle there though he be ravenous they do not hasten to food which they have scented from afar they stop at a branch which they encounter on their way apart from sight and smell what remains to guide them in returning to the nest the ribbon spun on the road in the cretan labyrinth theseus would have been lost but for the clue of thread with which ariadne supplied him the spreading maze of the pineneedles is especially at night a inextricable a labyrinth a that constructed for minos the processionary find his way through it without the possibility of a mistake by the aid of his bit of silk at the time for going home each easily recovers either his own thread or one or other of the neighbouring thread spread fanwise by the diverging herd one by one the scattered tribe line up on the common ribbon which started from the nest and the sated caravan find it way back to the manor with absolute certainty longer expedition are made in the daytime even in winter if the weather be fine our caterpillar then come down from the tree venture on the ground march in procession for a distance of thirty yard or so the object of these sally is not to look for food for the native pinetree is far from being exhausted the shorn branch hardly count amid the vast leafage moreover the caterpillar observe complete abstinence till nightfall the tripper have no other object than a constitutional a pilgrimage to the outskirt to see what these are like possibly an inspection of the locality where later on they mean to bury themselves in the sand for their metamorphosis it go without saying that in these greater evolution the guiding cord is not neglected it is now more necessary than ever all contribute to it from the produce of their spinnerets a is the invariable rule whenever there is a progression not one take a step forward without fixing to the path the thread hanging from his lip if the series forming the procession be at all long the ribbon is dilated sufficiently to make it easy to find nevertheless on the homeward journey it is not picked up without some hesitation for observe that the caterpillar when on the march never turn completely to wheel round on their tightrope is a method utterly unknown to them in order therefore to regain the road already covered they have to describe a zigzag whose winding and extent are determined by the leader fancy hence come gropings and roamings which are sometimes prolonged to the point of causing the herd to spend the night out of door it is not a serious matter they collect into a motionless cluster tomorrow the search will start afresh and will sooner or later be successful oftener still the winding curve meet the guidethread at the first attempt a soon a the first caterpillar ha the rail between his leg all hesitation cease and the band make for the nest with hurried step the use of this silktapestried roadway is evident from a second point of view to protect himself against the severity of the winter which he ha to face when working the pine caterpillar weave himself a shelter in which he spends his bad hour his day of enforced idleness alone with none but the meagre resource of his silkglands he would find difficulty in protecting himself on the top of a branch buffeted by the wind a substantial dwelling proof against snow gale and icy fog requires the cooperation of a large number out of the individual piledup atom the community obtains a spacious and durable establishment the enterprise take a long time to complete every evening when the weather permit the building ha to be strengthened and enlarged it is indispensable therefore that the corporation of worker should not be dissolved while the stormy season continues and the insect are still in the caterpillar stage but without special arrangement each nocturnal expedition at grazingtime would be a cause of separation at that moment of appetite for food there is a return to individualism the caterpillar become more or le scattered settling singly on the branch around each browse his pineneedle separately how are they to find one another afterwards and become a community again the several thread left on the road make this easy with that guide every caterpillar however far he may be come back to his companion without ever missing the way they come hurrying from a host of twig from here from there from above from below and soon the scattered legion reform into a group the silk thread is something more than a roadmaking expedient it is the social bond the system that keep the member of the community indissolubly united at the head of every procession long or short go a first caterpillar whom i will call the leader of the march or file though the word leader which i use for want of a better is a little out of place here nothing in fact distinguishes this caterpillar from the others it just depends upon the order in which they happen to line up and mere chance brings him to the front among the processionaries every captain is an officer of fortune the actual leader lead presently he will be a subaltern if the file should break up in consequence of some accident and be formed anew in a different order his temporary function give him an attitude of his own while the others follow passively in a close file he the captain toss himself about and with an abrupt movement fling the front of his body hither and thither a he march ahead he seems to be seeking his way doe he in point of fact explore the country doe he choose the most practicable place or are his hesitation merely the result of the absence of a guiding thread on ground that ha not yet been covered his subordinate follow very placidly reassured by the cord which they hold between their leg he deprived of that support is uneasy why can not i read what pass under his black shiny skull so like a drop of tar to judge by action there is here a small dose of discernment which is able after experimenting to recognize excessive roughness overslippery surface dusty place that offer no resistance and above all the thread left by other excursionist this is all or nearly all that my long acquaintance with the processionaries ha taught me a to their mentality poor brain indeed poor creature whose commonwealth ha it safety hanging upon a thread the procession vary greatly in length the finest that i have seen manœuvring on the ground measured twelve or thirteen yard and numbered about three hundred caterpillar drawn up with absolute precision in a wavy line but if there were only two in a row the order would still be perfect the second touch and follows the first by february i have procession of all length in the greenhouse what trick can i play upon them i see only two to do away with the leader and to cut the thread the suppression of the leader of the file produce nothing striking if the thing is done without creating a disturbance the procession doe not alter it way at all the second caterpillar promoted to captain know the duty of his rank offhand he selects and lead or rather he hesitates and grope the breaking of the silk ribbon is not very important either i remove a caterpillar from the middle of the file with my scissors so a not to cause a commotion in the rank i cut the piece of ribbon on which he stood and clear away every thread of it a a result of this breach the procession acquires two marching leader each independent of the other it may be that the one in the rear join the file ahead of him from which he is separated by but a slender interval in that case thing return to their original condition more frequently the two part do not become reunited in that case we have two distinct procession each of which wanders where it plea and diverges from the other nevertheless both will be able to return to the nest by discovering sooner or later in the course of their peregrination the ribbon on the other side of the break these two experiment are only moderately interesting i have thought out another one more fertile in possibility i propose to make the caterpillar describe a close circuit after the ribbon running from it and liable to bring about a change of direction have been destroyed the locomotive engine pursues it invariable course so long a it is not shunted on to a branchline if the processionaries find the silken rail always clear in front of them with no switch anywhere will they continue on the same track will they persist in following a road that never come to an end what we have to do is to produce this circuit which is unknown under ordinary condition by artificial mean the first idea that suggests itself is to seize with the forceps the silk ribbon at the back of the train to bend it without shaking it and to bring the end of it ahead of the file if the caterpillar marching in the van step upon it the thing is done the others will follow him faithfully the operation is very simple in theory but very difficult in practice and produce no useful result the ribbon which is extremely slight break under the weight of the grain of sand that stick to it and are lifted with it if it doe not break the caterpillar at the back however delicately we may go to work feel a disturbance which make them curl up or even let go there is a yet greater difficulty the leader refuse the ribbon laid before him the cut end make him distrustful failing to see the regular uninterrupted road he slant off to the right or left he escape at a tangent if i try to interfere and to bring him back to the path of my choosing he persists in his refusal shrivels up doe not budge and soon the whole procession is in confusion we will not insist the method is a poor one very wasteful of effort for at best a problematical success we ought to interfere a little a possible and obtain a natural closed circuit can it be done yes it lie in our power without the least meddling to see a procession march along a perfect circular track i owe this result which is eminently deserving of our attention to pure chance on the shelf with the layer of sand in which the nest are planted stand some big palmvases measuring nearly a yard and a half in circumference at the top the caterpillar often scale the side and climb up to the moulding which form a cornice around the opening this place suit them for their procession perhaps because of the absolute firmness of the surface where there is no fear of landslide a on the loose sandy soil below and also perhaps because of the horizontal position which is favorable to repose after the fatigue of the ascent it provides me with a circular track all readymade i have nothing to do but wait for an occasion propitious to my plan this occasion is not long in coming on the 30th of january 1896 a little before twelve oclock in the day i discover a numerous troop making their way up and gradually reaching the popular cornice slowly in single file the caterpillar climb the great vase mount the ledge and advance in regular procession while others are constantly arriving and continuing the series i wait for the string to close up that is to say for the leader who keep following the circular moulding to return to the point from which he started my object is achieved in a quarter of an hour the closed circuit is realized magnificently in something very nearly approaching a circle the next thing is to get rid of the rest of the ascending column which would disturb the fine order of the procession by an excess of newcomer it is also important that we should do away with all the silken path both new and old that can put the cornice into communication with the ground with a thick hairpencil i sweep away the surplus climber with a big brush one that leaf no smell behind itfor this might afterwards prove confusingi carefully rub down the vase and get rid of every thread which the caterpillar have laid on the march when these preparation are finished a curious sight awaits u in the uninterrupted circular procession there is no longer a leader each caterpillar is preceded by another on whose heel he follows guided by the silk track the work of the whole party he again ha a companion close behind him following him in the same orderly way and this is repeated without variation throughout the length of the chain none command or rather none modifies the trail according to his fancy all obey trusting in the guide who ought normally to lead the march and who in reality ha been abolished by my trickery from the first circuit of the edge of the tub the rail of silk ha been laid in position and is soon turned into a narrow ribbon by the procession which never cease dribbling it thread a it go the rail is simply doubled and ha no branch anywhere for my brush ha destroyed them all what will the caterpillar do on this deceptive closed path will they walk endlessly round and round until their strength give out entirely the old schoolman were fond of quoting buridans 14 as that famous donkey who when placed between two bundle of hay starved to death because he wa unable to decide in favour of either by breaking the equilibrium between two equal but opposite attraction they slandered the worthy animal the as who is no more foolish than any one else would reply to the logical snare by feasting off both bundle will my caterpillar show a little of his mother wit will they after many attempt be able to break the equilibrium of their closed circuit which keep them on a road without a turning will they make up their mind to swerve to this side or that which is the only method of reaching their bundle of hay the green branch yonder quite near not two foot off i thought that they would and i wa wrong i said to myself the procession will go on turning for some time for an hour two hour perhaps then the caterpillar will perceive their mistake they will abandon the deceptive road and make their descent somewhere or other that they should remain up there hard pressed by hunger and the lack of cover when nothing prevented them from going away seemed to me inconceivable imbecility fact however forced me to accept the incredible let u describe them in detail the circular procession begin a i have said on the 30th of january about midday in splendid weather the caterpillar march at an even pace each touching the stern of the one in front of him the unbroken chain eliminates the leader with his change of direction and all follow mechanically a faithful to their circle a are the hand of a watch the headless file ha no liberty left no will it ha become mere clockwork and this continues for hour and hour my success go far beyond my wildest suspicion i stand amazed at it or rather i am stupefied meanwhile the multiplied circuit change the original rail into a superb ribbon a twelfth of an inch broad i can easily see it glittering on the red ground of the pot the day is drawing to a close and no alteration ha yet taken place in the position of the trail a striking proof confirms this the trajectory is not a plane curve but one which at a certain point deviate and go down a little way to the lower surface of the cornice returning to the top some eight inch farther i marked these two point of deviation in pencil on the vase at the outset well all that afternoon and more conclusive still on the following day right to the end of this mad dance i see the string of caterpillar dip under the ledge at the first point and come to the top again at the second once the first thread is laid the road to be pursued is permanently established if the road doe not vary the speed doe i measure nine centimetre 15 a minute a the average distance covered but there are more or le lengthy halt the pace slackens at time especially when the temperature fall at ten oclock in the evening the walk is little more than a lazy swaying of the body i foresee an early halt in consequence of the cold of fatigue and doubtless also of hunger grazingtime ha arrived the caterpillar have come crowding from all the nest in the greenhouse to browse upon the pinebranches planted by myself beside the silken purse those in the garden do the same for the temperature is mild the others lined up along the earthenware cornice would gladly take part in the feast they are bound to have an appetite after a ten hour walk the branch stand green and tempting not a hand breadth away to reach it they need but go down and the poor wretch foolish slave of their ribbon that they are can not make up their mind to do so i leave the famished one at halfpast ten persuaded that they will take counsel with their pillow and that on the morrow thing will have resumed their ordinary course i wa wrong i wa expecting too much of them when i accorded them that faint gleam of intelligence which the tribulation of a distressful stomach ought one would think to have aroused i visit them at dawn they are lined up a on the day before but motionless when the air grows a little warmer they shake off their torpor revive and start walking again the circular procession begin anew like that which i have already seen there is nothing more and nothing le to be noted in their machinelike obstinacy this time it is a bitter night a cold snap ha supervened wa indeed foretold in the evening by the garden caterpillar who refused to come out despite appearance which to my duller sens seemed to promise a continuation of the fine weather at daybreak the rosemarywalks are all asparkle with rime and for the second time this year there is a sharp frost the large pond in the garden is frozen over what can the caterpillar in the conservatory be doing let u go and see all are ensconced in their nest except the stubborn processionists on the edge of the vase who deprived of shelter a they are seem to have spent a very bad night i find them clustered in two heap without any attempt at order they have suffered le from the cold thus huddled together ti an ill wind that blow nobody any good the severity of the night ha caused the ring to break into two segment which will perhaps afford a chance of safety each group a it revives and resume it walk will presently be headed by a leader who not being obliged to follow a caterpillar in front of him will posse some liberty of movement and perhaps be able to make the procession swerve to one side remember that in the ordinary procession the caterpillar walking ahead act a a scout while the others if nothing occurs to create excitement keep to their rank he attends to his duty a a leader and is continually turning his head to this side and that investigating seeking groping making his choice and thing happen a he decides the band follows him faithfully remember also that even on a road which ha already been travelled and beribboned the guiding caterpillar continues to explore there is reason to believe that the processionaries who have lost their way on the ledge will find a chance of safety here let u watch them on recovering from their torpor the two group line up by degree into two distinct file there are therefore two leader free to go where they please independent of each other will they succeed in leaving the enchanted circle at the sight of their large black head swaying anxiously from side to side i am inclined to think so for a moment but i am soon undeceived a the rank fill out the two section of the chain meet and the circle is reconstituted the momentary leader once more become simple subordinate and again the caterpillar march round and round all day for the second time in succession the night which is very calm and magnificently starry brings a hard frost in the morning the processionaries on the tub the only one who have camped out unsheltered are gathered into a heap which largely overflow both side of the fatal ribbon i am present at the awakening of the numbed one the first to take the road is a luck will have it outside the track hesitatingly he venture into unknown ground he reach the top of the rim and descends upon the other side on the earth in the vase he is followed by six others no more perhaps the rest of the troop who have not fully recovered from their nocturnal torpor are to lazy to bestir themselves the result of this brief delay is a return to the old track the caterpillar embark on the silken trail and the circular march is resumed this time in the form of a ring with a gap in it there is no attempt however to strike a new course on the part of the guide whom this gap ha placed at the head a chance of stepping outside the magic circle ha presented itself at last and he doe not know how to avail himself of it a for the caterpillar who have made their way to the inside of the vase their lot is hardly improved they climb to the top of the palm starving and seeking for food finding nothing to eat that suit them they retrace their step by following the thread which they have left on the way climb the ledge of the pot strike the procession again and without further anxiety slip back into the rank once more the ring is complete once more the circle turn and turn then when will the deliverance come there is a legend that tell of poor soul dragged along in an endless round until the hellish charm is broken by a drop of holy water what drop will good fortune sprinkle on my processionaries to dissolve their circle and bring them back to the nest i see only two mean of conjuring the spell and obtaining a release from the circuit these two mean are two painful ordeal a strange linking of cause and effect from sorrow and wretchedness good is to come and first shrivelling a the result of cold the caterpillar gather together without any order heap themselves some on the path some more numerous these outside it among the latter there may be sooner or later some revolutionary who scorning the beaten track will trace out a new road and lead the troop back home we have just seen an instance of it seven penetrated to the interior of the vase and climbed the palm true it wa an attempt with no result but still an attempt for complete success all that need be done would have been to take the opposite slope an even chance is a great thing another time we shall be more successful in the second place the exhaustion due to fatigue and hunger a lame one stop unable to go farther in front of the defaulter the procession still continues to wend it way for a short time the rank close up and an empty space appears on coming to himself and resuming the march the caterpillar who ha caused the breach becomes a leader having nothing before him the least desire for emancipation is all that he want to make him launch the band into a new path which perhaps will be the saving path in short when the processionaries train is in difficulty what it need unlike ours is to run off the rail the sidetracking is left to the caprice of a leader who alone is capable of turning to the right or left and this leader is absolutely nonexistent so long a the ring remains unbroken lastly the breaking of the circle the one stroke of luck is the result of a chaotic halt caused principally by excess of fatigue or cold the liberating accident especially that of fatigue occurs fairly often in the course of the same day the moving circumference is cut up several time into two or three section but continuity soon return and no change take place thing go on just the same the bold innovator who is to save the situation ha not yet had his inspiration there is nothing new on the fourth day after an icy night like the previous one nothing to tell except the following detail yesterday i did not remove the trace left by the few caterpillar who made their way to the inside of the vase this trace together with a junction connecting it with the circular road is discovered in the course of the morning half the troop take advantage of it to visit the earth in the pot and climb the palm the other half remains on the ledge and continues to walk along the old rail in the afternoon the band of emigrant rejoins the others the circuit is completed and thing return to their original condition we come to the fifth day the night frost becomes more intense without however a yet reaching the greenhouse it is followed by bright sunshine in a calm and limpid sky a soon a the sun ray have warmed the pane a little the caterpillar lying in heap wake up and resume their evolution on the ledge of the vase this time the fine order of the beginning is disturbed and a certain disorder becomes manifest apparently an omen of deliverance near at hand the scoutingpath inside the vase which wa upholstered in silk yesterday and the day before is today followed to it origin on the rim by a part of the band and is then abandoned after a short loop the other caterpillar follow the usual ribbon the result of this bifurcation is two almost equal file walking along the ledge in the same direction at a short distance from each other sometimes meeting separating farther on in every case with some lack of order weariness increase the confusion the crippled who refuse to go on are many breach increase file are split up into section each of which ha it leader who poke the front of his body this way and that to explore the ground everything seems to point to the disintegration which will bring safety my hope are once more disappointed before the night the single file is reconstituted and the invincible gyration resumed heat come just a suddenly a the cold did today the 4th of february is a beautiful mild day the greenhouse is full of life numerous festoon of caterpillar issuing from the nest meander along the sand on the shelf above them at every moment the ring on the ledge of the vase break up and come together again for the first time i see daring leader who drunk with heat standing only on their hinder prolegs at the extreme edge of the earthenware rim fling themselves forward into space twisting about sounding the depth the endeavour is frequently repeated while the whole troop stop the caterpillar head give sudden jerk their body wriggle one of the pioneer decides to take the plunge he slip under the ledge four follow him the others still confiding in the perfidious silken path dare not copy him and continue to go along the old road the short string detached from the general chain grope about a great deal hesitates long on the side of the vase it go halfway down then climb up again slantwise rejoins and take it place in the procession this time the attempt ha failed though at the foot of the vase not nine inch away there lay a bunch of pineneedles which i had placed there with the object of enticing the hungry one smell and sight told them nothing near a they were to the goal they went up again no matter the endeavour ha it us thread were laid on the way and will serve a a lure to further enterprise the road of deliverance ha it first landmark and two day later on the eighth day of the experiment the caterpillarsnow singly anon in small group then again in string of some lengthcome down from the ledge by following the stakedout path at sunset the last of the laggard is back in the nest now for a little arithmetic for seven time twentyfour hour the caterpillar have remained on the ledge of the vase to make an ample allowance for stop due to the weariness of this one or that and above all for the rest taken during the colder hour of the night we will deduct onehalf of the time this leaf eightyfour hour walking the average pace is nine centimetre 16 a minute the aggregate distance covered therefore is 453 metre a good deal more than a quarter of a mile which is a great walk for these little crawler the circumference of the vase the perimeter of the track is exactly 1 m 35 17 therefore the circle covered always in the same direction and always without result wa described three hundred and thirtyfive time these figure surprise me though i am already familiar with the abysmal stupidity of insect a a class whenever the least accident occurs i feel inclined to ask myself whether the processionaries were not kept up there so long by the difficulty and danger of the descent rather than by the lack of any gleam of intelligence in their benighted mind the fact however reply that the descent is a easy a the ascent the caterpillar ha a very supple back well adapted for twisting round projection or slipping underneath he can walk with the same ease vertically or horizontally with his back down or up besides he never move forward until he ha fixed his thread to the ground with this support to his foot he ha no fall to fear no matter what his position i had a proof of this before my eye during a whole week a i have already said the track instead of keeping on one level bend twice dip at a certain point under the ledge of the vase and reappears at the top a little farther on at one part of the circuit therefore the procession walk on the lower surface of the rim and this inverted position implies so little discomfort or danger that it is renewed at each turn for all the caterpillar from first to last it is out of the question then to suggest the dread of a false step on the edge of the rim which is so nimbly turned at each point of inflexion the caterpillar in distress starved shelterless chilled with cold at night cling obstinately to the silk ribbon covered hundred of time because they lack the rudimentary glimmer of reason which would advice them to abandon it experience and reflection are not in their province the ordeal of a five hundred yard march and three to four hundred turn teach them nothing and it take casual circumstance to bring them back to the nest they would perish on their insidious ribbon if the disorder of the nocturnal encampment and the halt due to fatigue did not cast a few thread outside the circular path some three or four move along these trail laid without an object stray a little way and thanks to their wandering prepare the descent which is at last accomplished in short string favoured by chance the school most highly honoured today is very anxious to find the origin of reason in the dreg of the animal kingdom let me call it attention to the pine processionary the pine processionary meteorology in january a second moult occurs leaving the caterpillar le fair to the eye while at the same time endowing him with some very peculiar organ when the moment ha come to shed their skin the processionaries cluster higgledypiggledy on the dome of the nest and there if the weather be mild remain motionless day and night it would seem a though the fact of their contact of their mutual discomfort while thus heaped together furnishes a resistance a fulcrum which favour the process of excoriation after this second moult the hair on the middle of the back are of a dull reddish colour which is made paler still by the interposition of numerous long white hair but this faded costume is accompanied by the singular organ which attracted the attention of réaumur who wa greatly perplexed a to their function in the place originally occupied by the scarlet mosaic eight segment of the caterpillar are now cleft by a broad transversal gash a sort of thicklipped mouth which open and gape wide at the caterpillar will or close without leaving a visible trace from each of these expanding mouth rise a tumour with a fine colourless skin a though the creature were exposing it tender inside and inflating it for the appearance is almost that which would be presented by the viscera protruding through skin incised by the scalpel two large darkbrown dot occupy the front face of the protuberance at the back are two short flat tuft of russet bristle which in the sunlight shine with a rich brilliancy all around is a radiating border of long white hair spread almost flat this protuberance is extremely sensitive at the slightest irritation it go in again and disappears under the dark integument in it place open an oval crater a sort of huge stoma which swiftly brings it lip together close and entirely disappears the long white hair that form a moustache and imperial around this mouth follow the movement of the contracting lip after first radiating from a centre and lying flat these hair rise like levelled wheat which the wind ha caught from beneath and meet to form a transversal crest perpendicular to the creature back this hairy erection produce a sudden modification in the caterpillar aspect the red shiny bristle have disappeared buried under the dark skin the white hair now standing on end form a hirsute mane an ashy tinge ha crept into the general colour of the costume when calm is restored a soon happens the slit open and yawn afresh the sensitive protuberance emerge quick to disappear once more should any cause for alarm occur these alternate expansion and contraction are rapidly repeated i provoke them at will in various way a slight puff of tobaccosmoke immediately cause the stoma to yawn and the protuberance to emerge one would think that the insect wa putting itself on it guard and displaying some special apparatus of information before long the protuberance go in again a second puff of smoke brings them out once more but if the smoke is too abundant too acrid the caterpillar wriggle and writhes without opening his apparatus or else i touch one or other of these uncovered protuberance very delicately with a bit of straw the pimple affected immediately contract draw into itself like the horn of the snail and is replaced by a gaping mouth which in it turn close usually but not always the segment excited by the contact of my straw is imitated by the others both front and back which close their apparatus one by one when undisturbed and in repose the caterpillar generally ha his dorsal slit expanded in moving he sometimes open and sometimes close them in either case expansion and contraction are frequently repeated constantly coming together and retreating under the skin the lip of the mouthlike opening therefore end by losing their brittle moustache of russet hair which break off in this way a sort of dust collect at the bottom of the crater a dust formed of broken hair which thanks to their barb soon collect into little tuft when the slit expands rather suddenly the central projection shoot out on the insect side it load of hairy remnant which the least breath blow into a cloud of golden atom highly disagreeable to the observer i shall have something to say presently of the itch to which he is at such time exposed are these peculiar stoma designed merely to collect the adjoining bristle and to grind them to powder are these fineskinned papillæ which inflate and ascend from the depth of their hidingplace intended to get rid of the accumulation of broken hair or is it the sole function of this peculiar apparatus to prepare at the expense of the caterpillar fleece an irritant dust which shall act a a mean of defence nothing tell u so certainly the caterpillar is not armed against the enquirer who from time to time take it into his head to come and examine him through a magnifyingglass it is even very doubtful whether he trouble at all about those passionate caterpillarlovers calosoma sycophanta 18 among insect and the cuckoo among bird those who consume such fare have a stomach expressly fashioned for the purpose a stomach that laugh at blistering hair and possibly find an appetizing stimulant in their sting no i do not see the motif that prompted the processionary to cleave his back with so many slit if he merely strip himself of his hair to throw an irritating dust in our eye there must certainly be something else in question réaumur mention these opening of which he made a brief study he call them stigma and is inclined to take them for exceptional breathingholes that they are not o my master no insect contrives airholes on it back moreover the magnifyingglass reveals no channel of communication with the interior respiration play no part here the solution of the enigma must lie elsewhere the protuberance that rise from those expanded cavity are formed of a soft pale hairless membrane which give the impression of a visceral hernia a though the caterpillar were wounded and exposing it delicate entrails to the air the sensitiveness just here is great the lightest touch with the point of a hairpencil cause the immediate indrawing of the protuberance and the closing of the containing lip the touch of a solid object even is not essential i pick up a tiny drop of water on the point of a pin and without shaking it off present this drop to the sensitive projection at the moment when contact occurs the apparatus contract and close up the recoil of the snail horn withdrawing the visual and olfactory organ into their sheath is no prompter everything seems to prove that these optional tumour appearing and disappearing at the caterpillar will are instrument of sensorial perception the caterpillar expose them to obtain information he shelter them under his skin to preserve their delicate function now what is it that they perceive this is a difficult question in which the habit of the processionary alone can afford u a little guidance during the whole winter the pine caterpillar are active only at night in the daytime when the weather is fine they readily repair to the dome of the nest and there remain motionless gathered into heap it is the hour of the openair siesta under the pale december and january sun a yet none leaf the home it is quite late in the evening towards nine oclock when they set out marching in an irregular procession to browse on the leaf of the branch hard by their grazing is a protracted affair the flock return late some time after midnight when the temperature fall too low secondly it is in the heart of winter during the roughest month that the processionary display his full activity indefatigably at this time of year he spin adding each night a new web to his silken tent at this time whenever the weather permit he venture abroad on the neighbouring bough to feed to grow and to renew his skein of silk by a very remarkable exception the harsh season marked by inactivity and lethargic repose in other insect is for him the season of bustle and labour on condition of course that the inclemency of the weather do not exceed certain limit if the north wind blow too violently so that it is like to sweep the flock away if the cold be too piercing so that there is a risk of freezing to death if it snow or rain or if the mist thicken into an icy drizzle the caterpillar prudently stay at home sheltering under their weatherproof tent it would be convenient to some extent to foresee these inclemency the caterpillar dread them a drop of rain set him in a flutter a snowflake exasperates him to start for the grazinggrounds at dark of night in uncertain weather would be dangerous for the procession go some distance and travel slowly the flock would fare ill before regaining shelter did any sudden atmospheric trouble supervene an event of some frequency in the bad season of the year so that he may be informed in this particular during his nocturnal winter ramble can the pine caterpillar be endowed with some sort of meteorological aptitude let u describe how the suspicion occurred to me divulged i know not how my rearing of caterpillar under glass acquired a certain renown it wa talked about in the village the forestranger a sworn enemy to destructive insect wanted to see the grazing of the famous caterpillar of whom he had retained a too poignant memory ever since the day when he gathered and destroyed their nest in a pinewood under his charge it wa arranged that he should call the same evening he arrives at the appointed hour accompanied by a friend for a moment we sit and chat in front of the fire then when the clock strike nine the lantern is lit and we all three enter the greenhouse the visitor are eager for the spectacle of which they have heard such wonderful thing while i am certain of satisfying their curiosity but but what is this not a caterpillar on the nest not one on the fresh ration of branch last night and on the previous night they came out in countless number tonight not one reveals himself can it be that they are merely late in going to dinner can their habitual punctuality be at fault because appetite ha not yet arrived we must be patient ten oclock nothing eleven still nothing midnight wa at hand when we abandoned our watch convinced that it would be vain to prolong the sitting you can imagine what an abject fool i looked at having thus to send my guest away next day i thought that i dimly perceived the explanation of this disappointment it rained in the night and again in the morning snow not the earliest of the year but so far the most abundant whitened the brow of the ventoux 19 had the caterpillar more sensitive than any of u to atmospheric change refused to venture forth because they anticipated what wa about to happen had they foreseen the rain and the snow which nothing seemed to announce at all event to u after all why not let u continue to observe them and we shall see whether the coincidence is fortuitous or not on this memorable day therefore the 13th of december 1895 i institute the caterpillar meteorological observatory i have at my disposal absolutely none of the apparatus dear to science not even a modest thermometer for my unlucky star continues in the ascendant proving a unkind today a when i learnt chemistry with pipebowls for crucible and bottle that once contained sweet for retort i confine myself to visiting nightly the processionaries in the greenhouse and those in the garden it is a hard task especially a i have to go to the far end of the enclosure often in weather when one would not turn a dog out of door i set down the act of the caterpillar whether they come out or stay at home i note the state of the sky during the day and at the moment of my evening examination to this list i add the meteorological chart of europe which the temp publishes daily if i want more precise data i request the normal school at avignon to send me on occasion of violent disturbance the barometrical record of it observatory these are the only document at my disposal before we come to the result obtained let me once more repeat that my caterpillar meteorological institute ha two station one in the greenhouse and one in the open air on the pine in the enclosure the first protected against the wind and rain is that which i prefer it provides more regular and more continuous information in fact the openair caterpillar often enough refuse to come out even though the general condition be favourable it is enough to keep them at home if there be too strong a wind shaking the bough or even a little moisture dripping on the web of the nest saved from these two peril the greenhouse caterpillar have only to consider atmospheric incident of a higher order the small variation escape them the great alone make an impression on them a most useful point for the observer and going a long way towards solving the problem for him the colony under glass therefore provide most of the material for my note the colony in the open air add their testimony which is not always quite clear now what did they tell me those greenhouse caterpillar who on the 13th of december refused to show themselves to my guest the forestranger the rain that wa to fall that night could hardly have alarmed them they were so well sheltered the snow about to whiten mont ventoux wa nothing to them it wa so far away moreover it wa neither snowing yet nor raining some extraordinary atmospheric event profound and of vast extent must have been occurring the chart in the temp and the bulletin of the normal school told me a much a cyclonic disturbance coming from the british isle wa passing over our district an atmospheric depression the like of which the season had not a yet known had spread in our direction reaching u on the 13th and persisting in a more or le accentuated form until the 22nd at avignon the barometer suddenly fell half an inch to 291 in on the 13th and lower still to 29 in on the 19th during this period of ten day the garden caterpillar made no sortie on the pinetrees true the weather wa changeable there were a few shower of fine rain and some violent gust of the mistral but more frequently there were day and night when the sky wa superb and the temperature moderate the prudent anchorite would not allow themselves to be caught the low pressure persisted menacing them and so they stopped at home in the greenhouse thing happen rather differently sortie take place but the stayingin day are still more numerous it look a though the caterpillar alarmed at first by the unexpected thing happening overhead had reassured themselves and resumed work feeling nothing in their shelter of what they would have suffered out of doorsrain snow and furious mistral blastsand had then suspended their work again when the threat of bad weather increased there is indeed a fairly accurate agreement between the oscillation of the barometer and the decision of the herd when the column of mercury rise a little they come out when it fall they remain at home thus on the 19th the night of the lowest pressure 29 in not a caterpillar venture outside a the wind and rain can have no effect on my colony under glass one is led to suppose that atmospheric pressure with it physiological result so difficult to define is here the principal factor a for the temperature within moderate limit there is no need to discus it the processionaries have a robust constitution a behoves spinner who work in the open air in midwinter however piercing the cold so long a it doe not freeze when the hour come for working or feeding they spin on the surface of the nest or browse on the neighbouring branch another example according to the meteorological chart in the temp a depression whose centre is near the iles sanguinaires at the entrance of the gulf of ajaccio reach my neighbourhood with a minimum of 292 in on the 9th of january a tempestuous wind get up for the first time this year there is a respectable frost the ice on the large pond in the garden is two or three inch thick this wild weather last for five day of course the garden caterpillar do not sally forth on the pinetrees while these are battered by such a gale the remarkable part of the business is that the greenhouse caterpillar do not venture out of their nest either and yet for them there are no bough dangerously shaken no cold piercing beyond endurance for it is not freezing under the glass what keep them in can be only the passage of that wave of depression on the 15th the storm cease and the barometer remains between 296 and 30 in for the rest of the month and a good part of february during this long period there are magnificent sortie every evening especially in the greenhouse on the 23rd and 24th of february suddenly the processionaries stop at home again for no apparent reason of the six nest under cover only two have a few rare caterpillar out on the pinebranches while previously in the case of all six i used every night to see the leaf bending under the weight of an innumerable multitude warned by this forecast i enter in my note some deep depression is about to reach u and i have guessed right two day later sure enough the meteorological record of the temp give me the following information a minimum of 292 in coming from the bay of biscay on the 22nd reach algeria on the 23rd and spread over the provence coast on the 24th there is a heavy snowfall at marseille on the 25th the ship i read in my paper present a curious spectacle with their yard and rigging white that is how the people of marseille little used to such sight picture spitzbergen and the north pole here certainly is the gale which my caterpillar foresaw when they refused to go out last night and the night before here is the centre of disturbance which revealed itself at sérignan by a violent and icy north wind on the 25th and the following day again i perceive that the greenhouse caterpillar are alarmed only at the approach of the wave of atmospheric disturbance once the first uneasiness caused by the depression had abated they came out again on the 25th and the following day in the midst of the gale a though nothing extraordinary were happening from the sum of my observation it appears that the pine processionary is eminently sensitive to atmospheric vicissitude an excellent quality having regard to his way of life in the sharp winter night he foresees the storm which would imperil his excursion his capacity for scenting bad weather very soon won the confidence of the household when we had to go into orange to renew our provision it became the rule to consult him the night before and according to his verdict we went or stayed at home his oracle never deceived u in the same way simple folk that we were we used in the old day to interrogate the dorbeetle 20 another doughty nocturnal worker but a little demoralized by imprisonment in a cage and apparently devoid of any special sensitive apparatus performing his evolution moreover in the mild autumn evening the celebrated dungbeetle could never rival the pine caterpillar who is active during the roughest season of the year and endowed a everything would seem to affirm with organ quick to perceive the great atmospheric fluctuation rural lore abounds in meteorological forecast derived from animal the cat sitting in front of the fire and washing behind her ear with a salivasmeared paw foretells another cold snap the cock crowing at unusual hour announces the return of fine weather the guineafowl with her screeching a of a scythe on the grindstone point to rain the hen standing on one leg her plumage ruffled her head sunk on her neck feel a hard frost coming the pretty green treefrog inflates his throat like a bladder at the approach of a storm and according to the provençal peasant say ploùra ploùra it will rain it will rain this rustic meteorology the heritage of the century doe not show up so badly beside our scientific meteorology are not we ourselves living barometer every veteran complains of his glorious scar when the weather is about to break one man though unwounded suffers from insomnia or from bad dream another though a brainworker can not drag an idea out of his impotent head each of u in his own way is tried by the passage of those huge funnel which form in the atmosphere and hatch the storm could the insect with it exceptionally delicate organization escape this kind of impression it is unbelievable the insect more than any other creature should be an animated meteorological instrument a truthful in it forecast if we knew how to read them a the lifeless instrument of our observatory with their mercury and their catgut all in different degree posse a general impressionability analogous to our own and exercised without the aid of specific organ some bettergifted because of their mode of life might well be furnished with special meteorological apparatus the pine processionary seems to belong to this number in his second costume when the segment bear on their dorsal face an elegant red mosaic he differs apparently from other caterpillar only by a more delicate general impressionability unless this mosaic be endowed with aptitude unknown elsewhere if the nocturnal spinner is still none too generously equipped it must be remembered that the season which he pass in this condition is nearly always clement the really formidable night hardly set in before january but then a a safeguard in his peregrination the pine processionary cleaves his back with a series of mouth which yawn open to sample the air from time to time and to give a warning of the sudden storm until further evidence is forthcoming therefore the dorsal slit are to my mind meteorological instrument barometer influenced by the main fluctuation of the atmosphere to go beyond suspicion though these are well based is for me impossible i lack the equipment necessary to delve more deeply into the subject but i have given a hint it is for those who are better favoured in the matter of resource to find the final solution of this interesting problem the pine processionary the moth when march come the caterpillar reared in domesticity never cease processioning many leave the greenhouse which remains open they go in search of a suitable spot for the approaching metamorphosis this is the final exodus the definite abandonment of the nest and the pinetree the pilgrim are much faded whitish with a few russet hair on their back on the 20th of march i spend a whole morning watching the evolution of a file some three yard in length containing about a hundred emigrant the procession toil grimly along undulating over the dusty ground where it leaf a furrow then it break into a small number of group which crowd together and remain quiescent save for sudden oscillation of the hindquarter after a halt of varying duration these group resume their march henceforward forming independent procession they take no settled direction this one go forward that one go back one turn to the left and another to the right there is no rule about their marching no positive goal one procession after describing a loop retraces it step yet there is a general tendency towards that wall of the greenhouse which face the south and reflects the sun ray with added fervour the sole guide it would seem is the amount of sun which a place obtains the direction whence the greatest heat come are preferred after a couple of hour of marching and countermarching the fragmentary procession comprising each a score of caterpillar reach the foot of the wall here the soil is powdery very dry easy to burrow in although made somewhat firmer by tuft of grass the caterpillar at the head of the row explores with his mandible dig a little investigates the nature of the ground the others trusting their leader follow him with docility making no attempt of their own whatever the foremost decides will be adopted by all here in the choice of a matter so important a the spot whereat the transformation shall take place there is no individual initiative there is only one will the leader there is only one head so to speak the procession may be compared with the chain of segment of an enormous worm finally some spot is recognized a propitious the leading caterpillar halt push with his head dig with his mandible the others still in a continuous line arrive one by one and likewise come to a halt then the file break up into a swarming heap in which each of the caterpillar resume his liberty all their back are joggling pellmell all their head are plunged into the dust all their foot are raking all their mandible excavating the soil the worm ha chopped itself into a gang of independent worker an excavation is formed in which little by little the caterpillar bury themselves for some time to come the undermined soil crack and rise and cover itself with little molehill then all is still the caterpillar have descended to a depth of three inch this is a far a the roughness of the soil permit them to go in looser soil the excavation would attain a much greater depth the greenhouse shelf supplied with fine sand ha provided me with cocoon placed at a depth of from eight to twelve inch i would not assert that the interment might not be made still lower down for the most part the burial is effected in common by more or le numerous cluster and at depth which vary greatly according to the nature of the soil a fortnight later let u dig at the point where the descent underground wa made here we shall find the cocoon assembled in bunch cocoon of sorry appearance soiled a they are with earthy particle held by silken thread when stripped of their rough exterior they are not without a certain elegance they are narrow ellipsoid pointed at both end measuring twentyfive millimetre in length and nine millimetre 21 in thickness the silk of which they are composed is very fine and of a dull white the fragility of the wall is remarkable when we have seen the enormous quantity of silk expended on the construction of the nest a prodigious spinner where his winter habitation is concerned the caterpillar find his gland exhausted and is reduced to the strictly necessary amount when the time come for making the cocoon too poor in silk he strengthens his flimsy cell with a facing of earth with him it is not the industry of the bembex 22 who insert grain of sand in her silky web and make a solid casket of the whole it is a summary sort of art devoid of delicacy which just casually stick together the surrounding earthy refuse moreover if circumstance demand it the pine caterpillar can do without earth in the very midst of the nest i have sometimesvery rarely it is truediscovered cocoon which were perfectly clean not a scrap of alien matter defiled their fine white silk i have obtained similar specimen by placing caterpillar under a bellglass in a pan provided only with a few pinetwigs better still an entire procession a goodsized one too gathered at the opportune moment and enclosed in a large box containing no sand nor any material whatever spun it cocoon with no other support than the bare wall these exception provoked by circumstance in which the caterpillar is not free to act according to his wont doe not in any way invalidate the rule to prepare for the transformation the processionary buries himself to the depth of nine inch and more if the soil permit here a curious problem force itself upon the observer mind how doe the moth contrive to ascend from the catacomb into which the caterpillar ha descended not in the finery of her perfect statethe big wing with their delicate scale the sweeping antennaplumesdare she brave the asperity of the soil or she would issue thence all tattered rumpled and unrecognizable and this is not the case far from it moreover what mean can she employ she so feeble to break the crust of earth into which the original dust will have turned after the slightest of shower the moth appears at the end of july or in august the burial took place in march rain must have fallen during this lapse of time rain which beat down the soil cement it and leaf it to harden once evaporation ha set in never could a moth unless attired and equipped with tool for the purpose break her way through such an obstacle she would perforce require a boringtool and a costume of extreme simplicity guided by these consideration i institute a few experiment which will give me the key to the riddle in april i make a copious collection of cocoon of these i place ten or twelve at the bottom of testtubes of different diameter and last of all i fill the apparatus with sandy soil sifted and very slightly moistened the content are pressed down but in moderation for fear of injuring the cocoon below when the month of august come the column of earth damp at the outset ha set so firmly thanks to evaporation that when i reverse the testtube nothing trickle out on the other hand some cocoon have been kept naked under a metallic cover these will teach me what the buried cocoon would not be able to show they furnish me in fact with record of the greatest interest on issuing from the cocoon the pine bombyx ha her finery bundled up and present the appearance of a cylinder with rounded end the wing the principal obstacle to underground labour are pressed against the breast like narrow scarf the antennæ another serious embarrassment have not yet unfolded their plume and are turned back along the moth side the hair which later form a dense fleece is laid flat pointing backwards the leg alone are free fairly active and endowed with a certain vigour thanks to this arrangement which doe away with all awkward projection the ascent through the soil is made possible true every moth at the moment of quitting her shell is this sort of swathed mummy but the pine bombyx ha in addition an exceptional aptitude rendered necessary by the fact that she hatch under the ground while the others once out of the cocoon hasten to spread their wing and are powerless to defer their development she by virtue of an indispensable privilege remains in her compact and wrappedup condition a long a circumstance demand it under my bellglasses i see some who though born upon the surface for twentyfour hour drag themselves over the sand or cling to the pinebranches before untying their sash and unfurling them a wing this delay is evidently essential to ascend from beneath the earth and reach the open air the moth ha to bore a long tunnel which requires time she will take good care not to spread her finery before emerging for it would hamper her and would itself be rumpled and badly creased therefore the cylindrical mummy persists until the deliverance is effected and if liberty happen to be acquired before the appointed moment the final evolution doe not take place until after a lapse of time in conformity with usage we are acquainted with the equipment for emergence the tightfitting jerkin indispensable in a narrow gallery now where is the boringtool the leg though free would here be insufficient they would scrape the earth laterally enlarging the diameter of the shaft but could not prolong the exit vertically above the insect head this tool must be in front pas the tip of your finger over the moth head you will feel a few very rough wrinkle the magnifyingglass show u more we find between the eye and higher up four or five transversal scale so set a to overlap one another they are hard and black and are trimmed crescentwise at the end the longest and strongest is the uppermost which is in the middle of the forehead there you have the centrebit of your boringtool to make our tunnel in granitic rock we tip our drill with diamond point for a similar task the bombyx a living drill wear implanted on her forehead a row of crescent hard and durable a steel a regular twistbit without suspecting it use réaumur wa perfectly aware of this marvellous implement which he called scaly stair what doe it profit this moth he asks that she should thus have the front of her head formed like scaly stair that is just what i do not know my testtubes learned master will tell u by good fortune of the numerous moth ascending from the bottom of my apparatus through a column of sand solidified by the evaporation of the original moisture some are making their way upwards against the side of the tube enabling me to follow their manœuvres i see them raising their cylindrical body butting with their head jerking now in one direction now in another the nature of their task is obvious the centrebits with an alternating movement are boring into the agglutinated sand the powdery wreckage trickle down from overhead and is at once thrust backward by the leg a little space form at the top of the vault and the moth move so much nearer to the surface by the following day the whole column ten inch in height will be perforated with a straight perpendicular shaft shall we now form an idea of the total work performed let u turn the testtube upside down the content a i have said will not fall out for they have set into a block but from the tunnel bored by the moth trickle all the sand crumbled by the crescent of the drill the result is a cylindrical gallery of the width of a leadpencil very cleanly cut and reaching to the bottom of the solid mass are you satisfied my master do you now perceive the great utility of the scaly stair would you not say that we have here a magnificent example of an instrument superlatively fitted for a definite task i share this opinion for i think with you that a sovereign reason ha in all thing coordinated the mean and the end but let me tell you we are called oldfashioned you and i with our conception of a world ruled by an intelligence we are quite out of the swim order balance harmony that is all silly nonsense the universe is a fortuitous arrangement in the chaos of the possible what is white might a easily be black what is round might be angular what is regular might be shapeless and harmony might just a well be discord chance ha decided all thing yes we are a pair of prejudiced old fogey when we linger with a certain fondness over the marvel of perfection who trouble about these futility nowadays socalled serious science the science which spell honour profit and renown consists in slicing your animal with very costly instrument into tiny circular section my housekeeper doe a much with a bunch of carrot with no higher pretension than to concoct a modest dish which is not an invariable success in the problem of life are we more successful when we have split a fibre into four and cut a cell into shaving it hardly seems so the riddle is a dark a ever ah how much better is your method my dear master above all how much loftier your philosophy how much more wholesome and invigorating here at last is the moth at the surface with the deliberate slowness demanded by so delicate an operation she spread her bunched wing extends her antennæ and puff out her fleece her costume is a modest one upper wing grey striped with a few crinkly brown streak underwing white thorax covered with thick grey fur abdomen clad in brightrusset velvet the last segment ha a palegold sheen at first sight it appears bare it is not however but in place of hair like those of the other segment it ha on it dorsal surface scale so well assembled and so close together that the whole seems to form a continuous block like a nugget let u touch this trinket with the point of a needle however gently we rub a multitude of scale come off and flutter at the least breath shining like mica spangle their concave form their shape an elongated oval their colouring white in the lower half but reddish gold in the upper give them if we allow for the difference in size a certain resemblance to the scale surrounding the head of some of the centaury tribe such is the golden fleece of which the mother will despoil herself in order to cover the cylinder of her egg the nugget of her hindquarter exfoliated spangle by spangle will form a roof for the germ arranged like the grain in a corncob i wa anxious to watch the actual placing of these pretty tile which are fixed at the pale end with a speck of cement leaving the coloured end free circumstance did not favour me inactive all day motionless on some needle of the lower branch the moth whose life is very short move only in the darkness of the night both her mating and egglaying are nocturnal on the morrow all is finished the bombyx ha lived under these condition it wa impossible by the doubtful beam of a lantern to follow satisfactorily the labour of the mother on the pinetrees in the garden i wa no more fortunate with the captive in my bellglasses a few did lay their egg but always at a very advanced hour of the night an hour which found my vigilance at fault the light of a candle and eye heavy with sleep were of little avail when it came to analysing the subtle operation of the mother a she put her scale in place we will say nothing of the little that wa imperfectly seen let u close with a few word of sylvicultural practice the pine processionary is a voracious caterpillar who while respecting the terminal bud protected by it scale and it resinous varnish completely denudes the bough and imperils the tree by leaving it bald the green pineneedles that mane in which the vegetable vigour of the tree resides are shorn to the root how are we to remedy this when consulted on the subject the forestranger of my parish told me that the custom is to go from tree to tree with pruningshears fitted on a long pole and to cut down the nest afterwards burning them the method is a troublesome one for the silken purse are often at considerable height moreover it is not without danger attacked by the hairy dust the destroyer soon experience intolerable discomfort a torture of irritation which make them refuse to continue the work to my thinking it would be better to operate before the appearance of the nest the pine bombyx is a very bad flyer incapable of soaring almost like the silkmoth she flutter about and blunder to earth again and her best effort barely succeed in bringing her to the lower branch which almost drag along the ground here are deposited the cylinder of egg at a height of six foot at most it is the young caterpillar who from one provisional encampment to another gradually ascend attaining stage by stage the summit upon which they weave their final dwelling once we grasp this peculiarity the rest is plain sailing in august we inspect the lower foliage of the tree an easy examination for it is carried on no higher than our head towards the far end of the twig it is easy to espy the bombyx egg packed into cylinder that resemble scaly catkin their size and their whitish colour make them show up amid the sombre green gathered with the double pineneedle that bear them these cylinder are crushed under foot a summary fashion of stamping out an evil before it spread this i have done in the case of the few pinetrees in my enclosure and the same might be done in the wider forest expanse and more especially in park and garden where symmetrical foliation is one of the great beauty of the tree i will add that it is wise to prune every bough that droop to earth and to keep the foot of the conifer bare to a height of six foot or so in the absence of these lower stair the only one that the bombyx with her clumsy flight can reach she will not be able to populate the tree the pine processionary the stinging power the pine processionary ha three costume that of infancy a scanty ragged fleece a mixture of black and white that of middle age the richest of the three when the segment deck themselves on their dorsal surface with golden tuft and a mosaic of bare patch scarlet in colour and that of maturity when the ring are cleft by slit which one by one open and close their thick lip champing and grinding their bristling russet beard and chewing them into little pellet which are thrown out on the creature side when the bottom of the pocket swell up like a tumour when wearing this last costume the caterpillar is very disagreeable to handle or even to observe at close quarter i happened quite unexpectedly to learn this more thoroughly than i wished after unsuspectingly passing a whole morning with my insect stooping over them magnifyingglass in hand to examine the working of their slit i found my forehead and eyelid suffering with redness for twentyfour hour and afflicted with an itching even more painful and persistent than that produced by the sting of a nettle on seeing me come down to dinner in this sad plight with my eye reddened and swollen and my face unrecognizable the family anxiously enquired what had happened to me and were not reassured until i told them of my mishap i unhesitatingly attribute my painful experience to the red hair ground to powder and collected into flake my breath sought them out in the open pocket and carried them to my face which wa very near the unthinking intervention of my hand which now and again sought to ease the discomfort merely aggravated the ill by spreading the irritating dust no the search for truth on the back of the processionary is not all sunshine it wa only after a night rest that i found myself pretty well recovered the incident having no further ill effect let u continue however it is well to substitute premeditated experiment for chance fact the little pocket of which the dorsal slit form the entrance are encumbered a i have said with hairy refuse either scattered or gathered into flake with the point of a paintbrush i collect when they gape open a little of their content and rub it on my wrist or on the inside of my forearm i have not long to wait for the result soon the skin turn red and is covered with pale lenticular swelling similar to those produced by a nettlesting without being very sharp the pain wa extremely unpleasant by the following day itching redness and lenticular swelling had all disappeared this is the usual sequence of event but let me not omit to say that the experiment doe not always succeed the efficacy of the fluffy dust appears subject to great variation there have been occasion when i have rubbed myself with the whole caterpillar or with his cast skin or with the broken hair gathered on a paintbrush without producing any unpleasant result the irritant dust seems to vary in quality according to certain circumstance which i have not been able to discover from my various test it is evident that the discomfort is caused by the delicate hair which the lip of the dorsal mouth gaping and closing again never cease grinding to the detriment of their beard and moustache the edge of these slit a their bristle rub off furnish the stinging dust having established this fact let u proceed to more serious experiment in the middle of march when the processionaries for the most part have migrated underground i decide to open a few nest a i wish to collect their last inhabitant for the purpose of my investigation without taking any precaution my finger tug at the silken dwelling which is made of solid stuff they tear it into shred search it through and through turn it inside out and back again once more and this time in a more serious fashion i am the victim of my unthinking enthusiasm hardly is the operation completed when the tip of my finger begin to hurt in good earnest especially in the more delicate part protected by the edge of the nail the feeling is like the sharp pain of a sore that is beginning to fester all the rest of the day and all through the night the pain persists troublesome enough to rob me of my sleep it doe not quiet down until the following day after twentyfour hour of petty torment how did this new misadventure befall me i had not handled the caterpillar indeed there were very few of them in the nest at the time i had come upon no shed skin for the moult do not take place inside the silken purse when the moment ha come to doff the second costume that of the red mosaic the caterpillar cluster outside on the dome of their dwelling and there leave in a single heap their old clothes entangled with bit of silk what is left to explain the unpleasant consequence to which the handling of the nest expose u the broken red bristle are left the fallen hair forming a dust that is invisible without a very careful examination for a long time the processionaries crawl and swarm about the nest they pas to and fro penetrating the thickness of the wall when they go to the pasture and when they return to their dormitory whether motionless or on the move they are constantly opening and closing their apparatus of information the dorsal mouth at the moment of closing the lip of these slit rolling on each other like the cylinder of a flatteningmill catch hold of the fluff near them tear it out and break it into fragment which the bottom of the pocket presently reascending shoot outside thus myriad of irritant particle are disseminated and subtly introduced into every part of the nest the shirt of nessus burnt the vein of whoso wore it the silk of the processionary another poisoned fabric set on fire the finger that handle it the loathsome hair long retain their virulence i wa once sorting out some handful of cocoon many of which were diseased a the hardness of the content wa usually an indication that something wa wrong i tore open the doubtful cocoon with my finger in order to save the noncontaminated chrysalids my sorting wa rewarded with the same kind of pain especially under the edge of the nail a i had already suffered when tearing the nest the cause of the irritation on this occasion wa sometimes the dry skin discarded by the processionary on becoming a chrysalis and sometimes the shrivelled caterpillar turned into a sort of chalky cylinder through the invasion of the malignant fungus six month later these wretched cocoon were still capable of producing redness and irritation examined under the microscope the russet hair the cause of the itching are stiff rod very sharp at either end and armed with barb along the upper half their structure ha absolutely nothing in common with nettlehairs those tapering phial whose hard point snap off pouring an irritant fluid into the tiny wound the plant from whose latin name urtica we derive the word urtication borrowed the design of it weapon from the fang of the venomous serpent it obtains it effect not by the wound but by the poison introduced into the wound the processionary employ a different method the hair which have naught resembling the ampullary reservoir of the nettlehairs must be poisoned on the surface like the assagai of the kafir and zulu do they really penetrate the epidermis are they like the savage javelin which can not be extracted once it ha gone in with their barb do they enter all the more deeply because of the quivering of the outraged flesh there is no ground for believing anything of the kind in vain do i scrutinize the injured spot through the magnifyingglass i can see no sign of the implanted dart neither could réaumur when an encounter with the oak processionary set him scratching himself he had his suspicion but could state nothing definitely no despite their sharp point and their barb which make them under the microscope such formidable spear the processionarys russet hair are not dart designed to imbed themselves in the skin and to provoke irritation by pricking many caterpillar all most inoffensive have a coat of bristle which under the microscope resolve themselves into barbed javelin quite harmless in spite of their threatening aspect let me mention a couple of these peaceable halberdier early in spring we see crossing the path a brisklymoving caterpillar who inspires repugnance by his ferocious hairiness which ripple like ripe corn the ancient naturalist with their artless and picturesque nomenclature called him the hedgehog the term is worthy of the creature which in the moment of danger roll itself up like a hedgehog presenting it spiny armour on all side to the enemy on it back is a dense mixture of black hair and hair of ashengray while on the side and forepart of the body is a stiff mane of bright russet black grey or russet all this fiercelooking coat is heavily barbed one hesitates to touch this horror with the fingertip still encouraged by my example sevenyearold paul with his tender child skin gather handful of the repulsive insect with no more apprehension than if he were picking a bunch of violet he fill his box with it he rear it on elmleaves and handle it daily for he know that from this frightful creature he will one day obtain a superb moth chelonia caja linn clad in scarlet velvet with the lower wing red and the upper white sprinkled with brown spot what resulted from the child familiarity with the shaggy creature not even a trace of itching on his delicate skin i do not speak of mine which is tanned by the year in the osierbeds of our local stream the rushing aygues a thorny shrub abounds which at the advent of autumn is covered with an infinity of very sour red berry it crabbed bough which bear but little verdure are hidden under their cluster of vermilion ball it is the sallow thorn or sea buckthorn hippophaë rhamnoides in april a very hairy but rather pretty caterpillar life at the expense of this shrub budding leaf he ha on his back five dense tuft of hair set side by side and arranged like the bristle of a brush tuft deepblack in the centre and white at the edge he wave two divergent plume in front of him and sport a third on his crupper like a feathery tail these three are black hairpencils of extreme delicacy his greyish moth flattened motionless on the bark stretch his long foreleg one against the other in front of him you would take them at a first glance for antenna of exaggerated proportion this pose of the extended limb ha won the insect the scientific label of orgyia arm length and also the vulgar and more expressive denomination of patte étendue or outstretched paw little paul ha not failed with my aid to rear the pretty bearer of the tuft and brush how many time with his sensitive finger ha he not stroked the creature furry costume he found it softer than velvet and yet enlarged under the microscope the caterpillar hair are horrible barbed spear no le menacing than those of the processionary the resemblance go no farther handled without precaution the tufted caterpillar doe not provoke even a simple rash nothing could be more harmless than his coat it is evident then that the cause of the irritation lie elsewhere than in the barb if the barbed bristle were enough to poison the finger most hairy caterpillar would be dangerous for nearly all have spiny bristle we find on the contrary that virulence is bestowed upon a very small number which are not distinguished from the rest by any special structure of the hair that the barb have a part to play that of fixing the irritant atom upon the epidermis of keeping it anchored in it place is after all possible but the shooting pain can not by any mean be caused by the mere prick of so delicate a harpoon much le slender the hair clustered into pad on the prickly pear are ferociously barbed woe to the finger that handle this kind of velvet too confidently at the least touch they are pierced with harpoon whose extraction involves a severe tax upon our patience other inconvenience there is little or none for the action of the barb is in this case purely mechanical supposinga very doubtful thingthat the processionarys hair could penetrate our skin they would act likewise only with le effect if they had merely their sharp point and their barb what then do they posse in addition they must have not inside them like the hair of the nettle but outside on the surface an irritant agent they must be coated with a poisonous mixture which make them act by simple contact let u remove this virus by mean of a solvent and the processionarys dart reduced to their insignificant mechanical action will be harmless the solvent on the other hand rid of all hair by filtration will be charged with the irritant element which we shall be able to test without the agency of the hair isolated and concentrated the stinging element far from losing by this treatment ought to gain in virulence so reflection tell u the solvent tried are confined to three water spirit of wine and sulphuric ether i employ the latter by preference although the other two spirit of wine especially have yielded satisfactory result to simplify the experiment instead of submitting to the action of the solvent the entire caterpillar who would complicate the extract with his fat and his nutritive juice i prefer to employ the cast skin alone i therefore collect on the one hand the heap of dry skin which the moult of the second phase ha left on the dome of the silken dwelling and on the other hand the skin which the caterpillar have rejected in their cocoon before becoming chrysalids and i leave the two lot to infuse separately in sulphuric ether for twentyfour hour the infusion is colourless the liquid carefully filtered is exposed to spontaneous evaporation and the skin are rinsed with ether in the filter several time over there are now two test to be made one with the skin and one with the product of maceration the first is a conclusive a can be hairy a in the normal state and perfectly dried the skin of both lot drained by the ether produce not the slightest effect although i rub myself with them without the least caution at the juncture of the finger a spot very sensitive to stinging the hair are the same a before the action of the solvent they have lost none of their barb of their javelinpoints and yet they are ineffectual they produce no pain or inconvenience whatever deprived of their toxic smearing these thousand of dart become so much harmless velvet the hedgehog caterpillar and the brush caterpillar are not more inoffensive the second test is more positive and so conclusive in it painful effect that one hardly like to try it a second time when the ethereal infusion is reduced by spontaneous evaporation to a few drop i soak in it a slip of blottingpaper folded in four so a to form a square measuring something over an inch too unsuspecting of my product i do thing on a lavish scale both a regard the superficial area of my poor epidermis and the quantity of the virus to any one who might wish to renew the investigation i should recommend a le generous dose lastly the square of paper that novel sort of mustardplaster is applied to the under surface of the forearm a thin waterproof sheeting cover it to prevent it from drying too rapidly and a bandage hold it in place for the space of ten hour i feel nothing then i experience an increasing itch and a burning sensation acute enough to keep me awake for the greater part of the night next day after twentyfour hour of contact the poultice is removed a red mark slightly swollen and very clearly outlined occupies the square which the poisoned paper covered the skin feel sore a though it had been cauterized and look a rough a shagreen from each of it tiny pustule trickle a drop of serous fluid which hardens into a substance similar in colour to gumarabic this oozing continues for a couple of day and more then the inflammation abates the pain hitherto very trying quiet down the skin dry and come off in little flake all is over except the red mark which remains for a long time so tenacious in it effect is this extract of processionary three week after the experiment the little square on the forearm subjected to the poison is still discoloured for thus branding one self doe one at least obtain some small reward yes a little truth is the balm spread upon the wound and indeed truth is a sovran balm it will come presently to solace u for much greater suffering for the moment this painful experiment show u that the irritation ha not a it primary cause the hairiness of the processionary here is no hair no barb no dart all of that ha been retained by the filter we have nothing now but a poisonous agent extracted by the solvent the ether this irritant element recall to a certain extent that of cantharides which act by simple contact my square of poisoned blottingpaper wa a sort of plaster which instead of raising the epidermis in great blister make it bristle with tiny pustule the part played by the barbed hair those atom which the least movement of the air disseminates in all direction is confined to conveying to our face and hand the irritant substance in which they are impregnated their barb hold them in place and thus permit the virus to act it is even probable that by mean of slight scratch which would otherwise pas unnoticed they assist the action of the stinging fluid shortly after handling the processionaries a delicate epidermis becomes tumefied red and painful without being immediate the action of the caterpillar is prompt the extract made with ether on the other hand cause pain and rubefaction only after a longish interval what doe it need to produce more rapid ulceration to all appearance the action of the hair the direct stinging caused by the caterpillar is nothing like so serious a that produced by the ethereal extract concentrated in a few drop never before in my most painful misadventure whether with the silken purse or their inhabitant have i seen my skin covered with serous pustule and peeling off in flake this time it is a veritable sore anything but pleasing to the eye the aggravation is easily explained i soaked in the ether some fifty discarded skin the few drop which remained after the evaporation and which were absorbed by the square of blottingpaper represented therefore the virulence of a single insect fifty time increased my little blisteringplaster wa equivalent to the contact of fifty caterpillar at the same spot there is no doubt that if we left them to steep in considerable number we should obtain extract of really formidable strength it is quite possible that medical science will one day make good use of this powerful counterirritant which is utterly different from cantharides whether voluntary victim of our curiosity which while affording no other satisfaction than that of knowledge expose u to an intolerable itch or sufferer through an accident what can we do to give a little relief to the irritation caused by the processionary it is good to know the origin of the evil but it would be better to apply a remedy one day with both hand sore from the prolonged examination of a nest i try without success lotion of alcohol glycerine oil and soapsuds nothing doe any good i then remember a palliative employed by réaumur against the sting of the oak processionary without telling u how he came to know of the strange specific the master rubbed himself with parsley and felt a good deal the better for it he add that any other leaf would probably assuage the irritation in the same way this is a fitting occasion for reopening the subject here in a corner of the garden is parsley green and abundant a one could wish what other plant can we compare with it i choose the purslain the spontaneous guest of my vegetablebeds mucilaginous and fleshy a it is it readily crush yielding an emollient liniment i rub one hand with parsley and the other with purslain pressing hard enough to reduce the leaf to a paste the result deserves attention with the parsley the burning is a little le acute it is true but though relieved it persists for a long time yet and continues troublesome with the purslain the petty torture cease almost at once and so completely that i no longer notice it my nostrum posse incontestable virtue i recommend it quietly without blatant advertisement to any one who may be persecuted by the processionary forester in their war upon caterpillar nest should find great relief from it i have also obtained good result with the leaf of the tomato and the lettuce and without pursuing this botanical survey further i remain convinced with réaumur that any tender juicy foliage would posse a certain efficacy a for the mode of action of this specific i admit that i do not understand it any more than i can perceive the mode of action of the caterpillar virus molières medical student explained the soporific property of opium by saying quia est in eo virtu dormitava cujus est proprietas sensus assoupire let u say likewise the crushed herb calm the burning itch because it posse a calming virtue whose property is to assuage itching the quip is a good deal more philosophical than it look what do we know of our remedy or of anything we perceive effect but we can not get back to their cause in my village and for some distance around it there is a popular belief that to relieve the pain of a wasp or bee sting all that we need do is to rub the part stung with three sort of herb take they say three kind of herb the first that come to hand make them into a bunch and rub hard the prescription by all account is infallible i thought at first that this wa one of those therapeutic absurdity which have their birth in rustic imagination after making a trial i admit that what sound like a nonsensical remedy sometimes ha something genuine about it friction with three kind of herb doe actually deaden the sting of the wasp or bee i hasten to add that the same success is achieved with a single herb and so the result agrees with what the parsley and purslain have taught u in respect of the irritation caused by the processionary why three herb when one is enough three is the preeminently lucky number it smack of witchcraft which is far from detracting from the virtue of the unguent all rustic medicine ha a touch of magic about it and there is merit in doing thing by three perhaps the specific of the three herb may even date back to the materia medica of antiquity dioscorides recommends τρίφυλλον it is he state good for the bite of venomous serpent to determine this celebrated threeleaved plant exactly would not be easy is it a common clover the psoralea with it pitchy odour the menyanthes or uckbean that inmate of the chilly peatbogs the oxalis the woodsorrel of the countryside we can not tell for certain the botany of those day wa innocent of the descriptive conscientiousness of ours the plant which acted a a poisonantidote grouped it leaf by three that is it essential characteristic again the cabalistic number essential to medical virtue a conceived by the first healer the peasant a tenacious conservative ha preserved the ancient remedy but by a happy inspiration ha changed the three original leaf into three different herb he ha elaborated the τρίφυλλον into the threefold foliage which he crush on the bee sting i seem to perceive a certain relation between these artless way and the crushing of parsley a described by réaumur the arbutus caterpillar i have not found many specie of urticating caterpillar in the small corner of my investigation i know of two only the pine caterpillar and the arbutus caterpillar the latter belongs to the genus liparis his moth who is a glorious snowy white with the last ring of the abdomen bright russet is very like liparis auriflua fab from whom she differs not only in sizeshe is smallerbut above all in the field of operation selected by her caterpillar is the specie classified in our list i do not know and really it is hardly worth while to enquire what doe a latin name matter when one can not mistake the insect i shall be sparing of detail concerning the arbutus caterpillar for he is far le interesting in his habit than the pine processionary only his ravage and his poison deserve serious attention on the sérignan hill sunny height upon which the mediterranean vegetation come to an end the arbutus or strawberrytree abounds a magnificent shrub with lustrous evergreen foliage vermilion fruit round and fleshy a strawberry and hanging cluster of little white bell resembling those of the lily of the valley when the frost come at the approach of december nothing could be more charming than the arbutus decking it gay verdure with both fruit and flower with coral ball and plump little bell alone of our flora it combine the flowering of today with the ripening of yesterday then the brightred raspberriesthe darbouses a we call them herebeloved by the blackbird grow soft and sweet to the palate the housewife pluck them and make them into preserve that are not without merit a for the shrub itself when the season for cutting ha come it is not despite it beauty respected by the woodman it serf like any trivial brushwood in the making of faggot for heating oven frequently too the showy arbutus is ravaged by a caterpillar yet more to be dreaded than the woodcutter after this glutton ha been at it it could not look more desolate had it been scorched and blackened by fire the moth a pretty little snowwhite bombyx with superb antennary plume and a cottonwool tippet on her thorax lay her egg on a leaf of the arbutus and in so doing start the evil you see a little cushion with pointed end rather le than an inch in length a white eiderdown tinged with russet thick very soft and formed of hair fixed with a little gum by the end that point towards the upper extremity of the leaf the egg are sunk in the thickness of this soft shelter they posse a metallic sheen and look like so many nickel granule hatching take place in september the first meal are made at the expense of the native leaf the later one at the expense of the leaf all around one surface only is nibbled usually the upper the other remains intact trellised by the network of vein which are too horny for the newborn grub the consumption of leaf is effected with scrupulous economy instead of grazing at hazard and using up the pasturage at the dictate of individual caprice the flock progress gradually from the base to the tip of the leaf with all head ranged in a frontal attack almost in a straight line not a bite is taken beyond this line until all that lie on this side of it is eaten up a it advance the flock throw a few thread across the denuded portion where nothing remains but the vein and the epidermis of the opposite surface thus is woven a gossamer veil serving a a shelter from the fierce ray of the sun and a the parachute which is essential to these weakling whom a puff of wind would carry away a the result of a more rapid desiccation on the ravaged surface the leaf soon begin to curl of it own accord curving into a gondola which is covered by a continuous awning stretched from end to end the herbage is then exhausted the flock abandon it and begin again elsewhere in the near neighbourhood after various temporary pasture of this kind in november when the cold weather is at hand the caterpillar settle permanently at the end of a bough nibbled one by one on their upper surface the leaf of the terminal bunch draw close to their neighbour which excoriated in their turn do the same until the whole form a bundle which look a if it had been scorched lashed together with magnificent white silk this is the winter habitation whence the family still very feeble will not issue until the fine weather return the assembling of this leafy framework is not due to any special industry on the caterpillar part they do not stretch their thread from leaf to leaf and then by pulling at these rope bring the various piece of the structure into contact it is merely the result of desiccation on the nibbled surface fixed cable it is true solidly bind together the leaf brought close to one another by the contraction due to their aridity but they do not in any way play the part of a motive mechanism in the work of the assemblage no haulingropes are here no capstan to move the timber the feeble creature would be incapable of such effort the thing happens of itself sometimes a floating thread the plaything of the air enlaces some adjacent leaf this chance footbridge tempts the explorer who hasten to strip the accidental prize and without other labour yet one more leaf bend of it own accord and is added to the enclosure for the most part the house is built by eating a lodging is procured by dint of banqueting a comfortable house tightly closed and wellcaulked proof against rain and snow we to guard ourselves against draught put sandbag against the crack of our door and window the extravagant little arbutus caterpillar applies piping of silkvelvet to his shutter thing should be cosy inside however damp the fog in bad weather the rain drip into my house the leafdwelling know nothing of such trouble so true is it that animal often enjoy advantage which relegate human industry to the second rank in this shelter of silk and foliage the worst three or four month of the year are passed in a state of complete abstinence no outing not a bite of food in march this torpor cease and the recluse those starving belly shift their quarter the community now split up into squad which spread themselves anyhow over the adjacent verdure this is the period of serious devastation the caterpillar no longer confine themselves to nibbling one surface of the leaf their keen appetite demand the whole of it down to the stalk and now stage by stage halt by halt the arbutus is shorn bare the vagabond do not return to their winter dwelling which ha become too closely cramped they reassemble in group and weave here there and everywhere shapeless tent temporary hut abandoned for others a the pasturage round about becomes exhausted the denuded bough to all seeming ravaged by fire take on the look of squalid dryinggrounds hung with rag in june having acquired their full growth the caterpillar leave the arbutustree descend to earth and spin themselves amid the dead leaf a niggardly cocoon in which the insect hair to some extent supplement it silk a month later the bombyx appears in his final dimension the caterpillar measure nearly an inch and a quarter in length his costume doe not lack richness or originality a black skin with a double row of orange speck on the back long grey hair arranged in bunch short snowwhite tuft on the side and a couple of brownvelvet protuberance on the first two ring of the abdomen and also on the last ring but one the most remarkable feature however consists of two tiny crater always open wide two cunningly fashioned goblet which might have been wrought from a drop of red sealingwax the sixth and seventh segment of the abdomen are the only one that bear these vermilion goblet placed in the middle of the back i do not know the function of these little cup perhaps they should be regarded a organ of information similar to the pine processionarys dorsal mouth the arbutus caterpillar is much dreaded in the village woodcutter faggotbinders brushwoodgatherers all are unanimous in reviling him they have such a painfully vivid memory of the irritation that when i listen to them i can hardly repress a movement of the shoulder to relieve the imaginary itching in the middle of my back i seem to feel the arbutusfaggot laden with it glowing rag rubbing my bare skin it is it appears a disagreeable job to cut down the shrub alive with caterpillar during the hottest part of the day and to shake under the blow of the axe that sort of upastree shedding poison in it shade a for me i have no complaint to make of my relation with the ravager of the arbutus i have very often handled him i have applied his fur to the tip of my finger my neck and even my face for hour at a time i have ripped up the nest to extract their population for the purpose of my research but i have never been inconvenienced save in exceptional circumstance the approach of the moult perhaps this would need a skin le tough than mine the thin skin of a child doe not enjoy the same immunity a witness little paul who having helped me to empty some nest and to collect the inhabitant with my forceps wa for hour scratching his neck which wa dotted with red wheal my ingenuous assistant wa proud of his suffering in the cause of science which resulted from heedlessness and also perhaps from bravado in twentyfour hour the trouble disappeared without leaving any serious consequence all this hardly tally with the painful experience of which the woodcutter talk do they exaggerate that is hardly credible they are so unanimous then something must have been lacking in my experiment the propitious moment apparently the proper degree of maturity in the caterpillar the high temperature which aggravates the poison to show itself in it full severity the urtication demand the cooperation of certain undefined circumstance and this cooperation wa wanting chance perhaps will one day teach me more than i want to know i shall be attacked in the manner familiar to the woodcutter and shall pas a night in torment tossing and turning a though on a bed of live coal what the direct contact of the caterpillar did not teach me the artifice of chemistry will demonstrate with a violence which i wa far from expecting i treat the caterpillar with ether just a i treated the slough of the pine processionary the number of the creature taken for the infusionthey are pretty small a yet are scarcely half the size which they will attain when matureis about a hundred after a couple of day maceration i filter the liquid and leave it to evaporate freely with the few drop that remain i soak a square of blottingpaper folded in four and apply it to the inner surface of my forearm with a thin rubber sheet and a bandage it is an exact repetition of what i did with the pine processionary applied in the morning the blister hardly take effect until the following night then by degree the irritation becomes unendurable and the burning sensation is so acute that i am tormented every moment with the desire to tear off the bandage however i hold out but at the cost of a sleepless feverish night how well i now understand what the woodcutter tell me i had le than a square inch of skin subjected to the torture what would it be if i had my back shoulder neck face and arm tormented in this fashion i pity you with all my heart you labourer who are troubled by the hateful creature on the morrow the infernal paper is removed the skin is red and swollen covered with tiny pimple whence ooze drop of serous fluid for five day the itching persists with a sharp burning pain and the running from the pimple continues then the dead skin dry and come off in scab all is over save the redness which is still perceptible a month later the demonstration is accomplished the arbutus caterpillar capable a he is of producing under certain condition the same effect which i obtain by artificial mean fully deserves his odious reputation an insect virus one step forward ha been taken but only a very little one a yet in the problem of the stinging caterpillar the drenching with ether teach u that hairiness play a very secondary part in the matter with it dust of broken bristle which the least breath waft in all direction it bother u by depositing and fixing it irritant coating upon u but this virus doe not originate in the creature fleece it come from elsewhere what is the source of it i will enter into a few detail perhaps in so doing i shall be of service to the novice the subject which is very simple and sharply defined will show u how one question give rise to another how experimental test confirm or upset hypothesis which are a it were a temporary scaffolding and lastly how logic that severe examiner lead u by degree to generality which are far more important than anything that we were led to anticipate at the outset and first of all doe the pine processionary posse a special glandular structure which elaborates the virus a do for instance the poisonglands of the wasp and bee by no mean anatomy show that the internal structure of the stinging caterpillar is similar to that of the harmless one there is nothing more and nothing le the poisonous product of unlocalized origin result therefore from a general process in which the entire organism is brought into play it should in consequence be found in the blood after the manner of urea in higher animal this is a suggestion of grave import but after all quite valueless without the conclusive verdict of actual experiment five or six processionaries pricked with the point of a needle furnish me with a few drop of blood i allow these to soak into a small square of blottingpaper which i then apply to my forearm with a waterproof bandage it is not without a certain anxiety that i await the outcome of the experiment the result will show whether the conclusion already forming in my mind will receive a solid basis or vanish into thin air at a late hour of the night the pain wake me a pain which this time is an intellectual joy my anticipation were correct the blood doe indeed contain the venomous substance it cause itching swelling a burning sensation an exudation of serum and lastly a shedding of the skin i learn more than i had hoped to learn the test is more valuable than that of mere contact with the caterpillar could have been instead of treating myself with the small quantity of poison with which the hair are smeared i have gone to the source of the irritant substance and i thereby gain an increase of discomfort very happy in my suffering which set me on a safe path i continue my enquiry by arguing thus the virus in the blood can not be a living substance one that take part in the working of the organism it is rather like urea a form of decay an offthrow of the vital process a waste product which is expelled a and when it form if this be the case i ought to find it in the caterpillar droppings which are made up of both the digestive and the urinary residue let u describe the new experiment which is no le positive than the last i leave a few pinch of very dry droppings such a are found in abundance in the old nest to soak for two day in sulphuric ether the liquid coloured a it is with the chlorophyll of the caterpillar food turn a dirty green then i repeat precisely the process which i mentioned when i wanted to prove the innocuousness of the hair deprived of their poisonous varnish i refer to it a second time in order thoroughly to explain the method pursued and to save repetition in the various experiment undertaken the infusion is filtered spontaneously evaporated and reduced to a few drop with which i soak my stinger this consists of a small piece of blottingpaper folded in four to increase the thickness of the pad and to give it a greater power of absorption an area of a square inch or le suffices in some case it is even too much a novice in this kind of researchwork i wa too lavish with the liniment and in return for my generosity i had such a bad time that i make a point of warning any reader desirous of repeating the experiment upon his own person fully soaked the square of paper is applied to the forearm on the inner surface where the skin is more tender a sheet of rubber cover it and being waterproof guard against the loss of the poison finally a linen bandage keep the whole in place on the afternoon of the 4th of june 1897 a memorable date for me i test a i have just said the etheric extract of the processionarys droppings all night long i feel a violent itching a burning sensation and shooting pain on the following day after twenty hour of contact i remove the dressing the venomous liquid too lavishly employed in my fear of failure ha considerably overflowed the limit of the square of paper the part which it ha touched and still more the portion covered by the pad are swollen and very red moreover in the latter case the skin is ridged wrinkled and mortified it smart a little and itch and that is all on the following day the swelling becomes more pronounced and go deep into the muscle which when touched with the finger throb like an inflamed cheek the colour is a bright carmine and extends all round the spot which the paper covered this is due to the escape of some of the liquid there is a plentiful discharge of serum oozing from the sore in tiny drop the smarting and itching increase and become so intense especially during the night that to get a little sleep i am driven to employ a palliative vaseline with borax and a lint dressing in five day time it ha developed into a hideous ulcer which look more painful than it really is the red swollen flesh quivering and denuded of it epidermis provokes commiseration the person who night and morning renews my dressing of lint and vaseline is almost sick at the sight one would think she say that the dog had been gnawing your arm i do hope you wont try any more of those horrible decoction i allow my sympathetic nurse to talk away and am already meditating further experiment some of which will be equally painful o sacred truth what can rival thy power over u mortal thou turnest my petty torment into contentment thou makest me rejoice in my flayed arm what shall i gain by it all i shall know why a wretched caterpillar set u scratching ourselves nothing more and that is enough for me three week later new skin is forming but is covered all over with painful little pimple the swelling diminishes the redness persists and is still very marked the effect of the infernal paper last a long time at the end of a month i still feel an itching a burning irritation which is intensified by the warmth of the bedclothes at last a fortnight later all ha disappeared but the redness of which i shall retain the mark for a long time yet though it grows gradually fainter and fainter it will take three month or more to vanish altogether we now have some light on the problem the processionarys virus is certainly an offthrow of the organic factory a waste product of the living edifice the caterpillar discard it with his excrement but the material of the droppings ha a twofold origin the greater part represents the digestive residuum the rest in a much smaller proportion is composed of the urinary product to which of the two doe the virus belong before going farther let u permit ourselves a digression which will assist u in our subsequent enquiry let u ask what advantage the processionary derives from his urticating product i already hear the answer it is a mean of protection of defence with his poisoned mane he repels the enemy i do not clearly perceive the bearing of this explanation i think of the creature recognized enemy of the larva of calosoma sycophanta which life in the nest of the processionary of the oak and gobble up the inhabitant with never a thought of their burning fleece of the cuckoo another mighty consumer so we are told of the same caterpillar who gorge on them to the point of implanting in his gizzard a bristling coat of their hair i am not aware if the processionary of the pine pay a like tribute i do know of at least one of his exploiter this is a dermestes 23 who establishes himself in the silken city and feed upon the remains of the defunct caterpillar this ghoul assures u of the existence of other consumer all furnished with stomach expressly fashioned for such highlyseasoned fare for every harvest of living creature there is always a harvester no the theory of a special virus expressly prepared to defend the processionary and his emulator in urtication is not the last word on the subject i should find it difficult to believe in such a prerogative why have these caterpillar more than others need of protection what reason would make of them a caste apart endowed with an exceptional defensive venom the part which they play in the entomological world doe not differ from that of other caterpillar hairy or smooth it is the naked caterpillar who in default of a mane capable of striking awe into the assailant ought one would think to arm themselves against danger and impregnate themselves with corrosive instead of remaining a meek and easy prey is it likely that the shaggy bristling caterpillar should anoint his fleece with a formidable cosmetic and his smoothcoated kinsman be unfamiliar with the chemical property of the poison beneath his satin skin these contradiction do not inspire confidence have we not here rather a property common to all caterpillar smoothskinned or hairy among the latter there might be some just a few who under certain special condition which will need to be defined would be quick to reveal by urtication the venomous nature of their organic refuse the others the vast majority living outside these condition even though endowed with the necessary product would be inexpert at the stinging business and would not produce irritation by contact in all the same virus is to be found resulting from an identical vital process sometimes it is brought into prominence by the itching which it produce sometimes indeed most often it remains latent unrecognized if our artifice do not intervene what shall these artifice be something very simple i address myself to the silkworm if there be an inoffensive caterpillar in the world it is certainly he woman and child take him up by the handful in our silkwormnurseries and their delicate finger are none the worse for it the satinskinned caterpillar is perfectly innocuous to a skin almost a tender a his own but this lack of caustic venom is only apparent i treat with ether the excretion of the silkworm and the infusion concentrated into a few drop is tested according to the usual method the result is wonderfully definite a smarting sore on the arm similar in it mode of appearance and in it effect to that produced by the droppings of the processionary assures me that logic wa right yes the virus which make one scratch so much which blister and eats away the skin is not a defensive product vested in only a few caterpillar i recognize it with it invariable property even in a caterpillar which at first sight appears a though it could not posse anything of the kind the silkworm virus besides is not unknown in my village the casual observation of the peasantwoman ha outstripped the precise observation of the man of science the woman and girl entrusted with the rearing of the silkwormthe magnanarelles a they are calledcomplain of certain tribulation caused they say by lou verin di magnan the silkworm poison this trouble consists of a violent itching of the eyelid which become red and swollen in the case of the more susceptible there is a rash and the skin peel off the forearm which the turnedup sleeve fail to protect during work i now know the cause of this little trouble my plucky magnanarelles it is not contact with the worm that afflicts you you need have no fear of handling him it is only the litter that you need distrust there jumbled up with the remains of the mulberryleaves is a copious mass of droppings impregnated with the substance which ha just so painfully eaten into my skin there and there only is lou verin a you call it it is a relief merely to know the cause of one trouble but i will provide you with another consolation when you remove the litter and renew the leaf you should raise the irritant dust a little a possible you should avoid lifting your hand to your face above all to your eye and it is just a well to turn down your sleeve in order to protect your arm if you take these precaution you will suffer no unpleasantness the successful result obtained with the silkworm caused me to foresee a similar success with any caterpillar that i might come across the fact fully confirmed my expectation i tested the stercoral pellet of various caterpillar not selected but just a the hazard of collecting provided them the great tortoiseshell the heath fritillary the large cabbage butterfly the spurge hawkmoth the great peacock moth the deathshead moth the pussmoth the tigermoth and the arbutus liparis all my test with not a single exception brought about stinging of various degree of violence it is true i attribute these difference in the result to the greater or lesser quantity of the virus employed for it is impossible to measure the dose so the urticating excretion is common to all the caterpillar by a very unexpected reversion of the usual order of thing the popular repugnance is wellfounded prejudice becomes truth all caterpillar are venomous we must draw a distinction however with the same venomous property some are inoffensive and others far le numerous are to be feared whence come this difference i note that the caterpillar marked out a stinging live in community and weave themselves dwelling of silk in which they stay for long period moreover they are furry of this number are the pine processionary the oak processionary and the caterpillar of various lipares let u consider the firstnamed in particular his nest a voluminous bag spun at the tip of a branch is magnificent in it silky whiteness on the outside inside it is a disgusting cesspit the colony remains in it all day and for the greater part of the night it sally forth in procession only in the late hour of twilight to browse upon the adjacent foliage this long internment lead to a considerable accumulation of droppings in the heart of the dwelling from all the thread of this labyrinth hang chaplet of these droppings the wall are upholstered with them in all the corridor the little narrow chamber are encumbered with them from a nest the size of a man head i have obtained with a sieve over threequarters of a pint of stercoral pellet now it is in the midst of this ordure that the caterpillar live and have their being in the midst of it they move swarm and sleep the result of this utter contempt for the rule of cleanliness are obvious certainly the processionary doe not soil his coat by contact with those dry pellet he leaf his home with his costume neat and glossy suggesting not a suspicion of uncleanliness no matter by constantly rubbing against the droppings his bristle are inevitably smeared with virus and their barb poisoned the caterpillar becomes irritant because his manner of life subject him to prolonged contact with his own ordure now consider the hedgehog caterpillar why is he harmless despite his fierce and hirsute aspect because he life in isolation and is always on the move his mane apt though it be to collect and retain irritant particle will never give u the itch for the simple reason that the caterpillar doe not lie on his excretion distributed all over the field and far from numerous owing to the caterpillar solitary habit the droppings though poisonous can not transfer their property to a fleece which doe not come into contact with them if the hedgehog lived in a community in a nest serving a a cesspit he would be the foremost of our stinging caterpillar at first sight the barrackrooms of the silkwormnurseries seem to fulfil the condition necessary to the surface venom of the worm each change of litter result in the removal of basketful of droppings from the tray over this heapedup ordure the silkworm swarm how is it that they do not acquire the poisonous property of their own excrement i see two reason in the first place they are hairless and a brushlike coat may well be indispensable to the collection of the virus in the second place far from lying in the filth they live above the soiled stratum being largely separated from it by the bed of leaf which is renewed several time a day despite crowding the population of a tray ha nothing that can be compared with the ordinary habit of the processionary and so it remains harmless in spite of it stercoral toxin these first enquiry lead u to conclusion which themselves are very remarkable all caterpillar excrete an urticating matter which is identical throughout the series but if the poison is to manifest itself and to cause u that characteristic itching it is indispensable that the caterpillar shall dwell in a community spending long period in the nest a silken bag laden with droppings these furnish the virus the caterpillar hair collect it and transfer it to u the time ha come to tackle the problem from another point of view is this formidable matter which always accompanies the excretion a digestive residuum is it not rather one of those waste substance which the organism engenders while at work waste substance designated by the general appellation of urinary product to isolate these product to collect them separately would scarcely be practicable if we did not have recourse to what follows on the metamorphosis every moth on emerging from her chrysalis reject a copious mixture of uric acid and various humour of which very little is a yet known it may be compared with the broken plaster of a building rebuilt on a new plan and represents the byproduct of the mighty labour accomplished in the transfigured insect these remains are essentially urinary product with no admixture of digested foodstuff to what insect shall i apply for this residuum chance doe many thing i collect from the old elmtree in the garden about a hundred curious caterpillar they have seven row of prickle of an amber yellow a sort of bush with four or five branch i shall learn from the butterfly that they belong to the great tortoiseshell vanessa polychloros lin reared on elmleaves under a wiregauze cover my caterpillar undergo their transformation towards the end of may their chrysalids are specked with brown on a whitish ground and display on the under surface six radiant silvery spot a sort of decorative tinsel like so many mirror fixed by the tail with a silken pad they hang from the top of the dome swinging at the least movement and emitting vivid flash of light from their reflector my child are amazed at this living chandelier it is a treat for them when i allow them to come and admire it in my animal studio another surprise awaits them this time a tragic one however a fortnight later the butterfly emerge i have placed under the cover a large sheet of white paper which will receive the desired product i call the child what do they see on the paper large spot of blood under their very eye from up there at the top of the dome a butterfly let fall a great red drop plop no joy for the child today anxiety rather almost fear i send them away saying to them be sure and remember kiddy what you have just seen and if ever any one talk to you about shower of blood dont be silly and frightened a pretty butterfly is the cause of those bloodred stain which have been known to terrify countryfolk the moment she is born she cast out in the form of a red liquid the remains of her old caterpillar body a body remodelled and reborn in a beautiful shape that is the whole secret when my artless visitor have departed i resume my examination of the rain of blood falling under the cover still clinging to the shell of it chrysalis each tortoiseshell ejects and shed upon the paper a great red drop which if left standing deposit a powdery pink sediment composed of urate the liquid is now a deep crimson when the whole thing is perfectly dry i cut out of the spotted paper some of the richer stain and steep the bit in ether the spot on the paper remain a red a at the outset and the liquid assumes a light lemon tint when reduced by evaporation to a few drop this liquid provides me with what i require to soak my square of blottingpaper what shall i say to avoid repeating myself the effect of the new caustic are precisely the same a those which i experienced when i used the droppings of the processionary the same itching the same burning the same swelling with the flesh throbbing and inflamed the same serous exudation the same peeling of the skin the same persistent redness which lingers for three or four month long after the ulceration itself ha disappeared without being very painful the sore is so irksome and above all look so ugly that i swear never to let myself in for it again henceforth without waiting for the thing to eat into my flesh i shall remove the caterpillar plaster a soon a i feel a conclusive itching in the course of these painful experience friend upbraid me with not having recourse to the assistance of some animal such a the guineapig that stock victim of the physiologist i take no note of their reproach the animal is a stoic it say nothing of it suffering if the torture being a little too intense it complains i am in no position to interpret it cry exactly or to attribute them to a definite impression the guineapig will not say it smart it itch it burn he will simply say that hurt a i want to know the detail of the sensation experienced the best thing is to resort to my own skin the only witness on whose evidence i can rely implicitly at the risk of provoking a smile i will venture on another confession a i begin to see into the matter more clearly i hesitate to torture or destroy a single creature in god great community the life of the least of these is a thing to be respected we can take it away but we can not give it peace to those innocent so little interested in our investigation what doe our restless curiosity matter to their calm and sacred ignorance if we wish to know let u pay the price ourselves a far a possible the acquisition of an idea is well worth the sacrifice of a bit of skin the elm tortoiseshell with her rain of blood may leave u to a certain extent in doubt might not this strange red substance with it unusual appearance contain a poison which is likewise exceptional i address myself therefore to the mulberry bombyx to the pine bombyx and to the great peacock i collect the uric excretion ejected by the newly hatched moth this time the liquid is whitish sullied here and there with uncertain tint there is no bloodred colouration but the result is the same the virulent energy manifest itself in the most definite manner therefore the processionarys virus exists equally in all caterpillar in all butterfly and moth emerging from the chrysalis and this virus is a byproduct of the organism a urinary product the curiosity of our mind is insatiable the moment a reply is obtained a fresh question arises why should the lepidoptera alone be endowed in this manner the organic labour accomplished within them can not differ greatly a to the nature of the material from those presiding over the maintenance of life in other insect therefore these others also elaborate a byproduct which ha stinging power this can be verifiedand that forthwithwith the element at my disposal the first reply is furnished by cetonia floricola of which beetle i collect half a dozen chrysalids from a heap of leaf halfconverted into mould a box receives my find laid on a sheet of white paper on which the urinary fluid of the perfect insect will fall a soon a the casket are broken the weather is favourable and i have not long to wait the thing is done the matter rejected is white the usual colour of these residuum in the great majority of insect at the moment of the metamorphosis though by no mean abundant it nevertheless provokes on my forearm a violent itching together with mortification of the skin which come off in flake the reason why it doe not display a more distinct sore is that i judged it prudent to end the experiment the burning and itching tell me enough a to the result of a contact unduly prolonged now to the hymenoptera i have not in my possession i regret to say any of those with whom my rearingchambers used formerly to provide me whether honeybee or hunting wasp i have only a green sawfly whose larva life in numerous family on the leaf of the alder reared under cover this larva provides me with enough tiny black droppings to fill a thimble that is sufficient the urtication is quite definite i take next the insect with incomplete transformation my recent rearing have given me quite a collection of excretion emanating from the orthoptera i consult those of the vine ephippiger 24 and the great grey locust both sting to a degree which once more make me regret my lavish hand we will be satisfied with this indeed my arm demand a much for tattooed with red square they refuse to make room for fresh branding the example are sufficiently varied to impose the following conclusion the processionarys virus is found in a host of other insect apparently even in the entire series it is a urinary product inherent in the entomological organism the dejection of insect especially those evacuated at the end of the metamorphosis contain or are even almost entirely composed of urate can the stinging material be the inevitable associate of uric acid it should then form part of the excrement of the bird and the reptile which in both case is very rich in urate here again is a suspicion worthy of verification by experiment for the moment it is impossible for me to question the reptile it is easy on the other hand to interrogate the bird whose reply will suffice i accept what is offered by chance an insectivorous bird the swallow and a graminivorous bird the goldfinch well their urinary dejection when carefully separated from the digestive residuum have not the slightest stinging effect the virus that cause itching is independent therefore of uric acid it accompanies it in the insect class without being it invariable concomitant every elsewhere a last step remains for u to take namely to isolate the stinging element and to obtain it in quantity permitting of precise enquiry into it nature and property it seems to me that medical science might turn to account a material whose energy rival that of cantharides if it doe not exceed it the question appeal to me i would gladly return to my beloved chemistry but i should want reagent apparatus a laboratory a whole costly arsenal of which i must not dream afflicted a i am with a terrible ailment impecuniosity the searcher habitual lot the psyche the laying in the springtime old wall and dusty road harbour a surprise for whoso ha eye to see tiny faggot for no apparent reason set themselves in motion and make their way along by sudden jerk the inanimate come to life the immovable stir how doe this come about look closer and the motive power will stand revealed enclosed within the moving bundle is a fairly welldeveloped caterpillar prettily striped in black and white seeking for food or perhaps for a spot where the transformation can be effected he hurry along timidly attired in a queer rigout of twig from which nothing emerges except the head and the front part of the body which is furnished with six short leg at the least alarm he go right in and doe not budge again this is the whole secret of the little roaming bundle of stick the faggot caterpillar belongs to the psyche group whose name conveys an allusion to the classic psyche symbolical of the soul we must not allow this phrase to carry our thought to loftier height than is fitting the nomenclator with his rather circumscribed view of the world did not trouble about the soul when inventing his descriptive label he simply wanted a pretty name and certainly he could have hit on nothing better to protect himself from the weather our chilly bareskinned psyche build himself a portable shelter a travelling cottage which the owner never leaf until he becomes a moth it is something better than a hut on wheel with a thatched roof to it it is a hermit frock made of an unusual sort of frieze in the valley of the danube the peasant wear a goatskin cloak fastened with a belt of rush the psyche don an even more rustic apparel he make himself a suit of clothes out of hoppoles it is true that beneath this rude conglomeration which would be a regular hairshirt to a skin a delicate a his he put a thick lining of silk the clythra beetle garb himself in pottery this one dress himself in a faggot in april on the wall of my chief observatory that famous pebbly acre with it wealth of insect life i find the psyche who is to furnish me with my most circumstantial and detailed record 25 he is at this period in the torpor of the approaching metamorphosis a we can ask him nothing else for the moment let u look into the construction and composition of his faggot it is a not irregular structure spindleshaped and about an inch and a half long the piece that compose it are fixed in front and free at the back are arranged anyhow and would form a rather ineffective shelter against the sun and rain if the recluse had no other protection than his thatched roof the word thatch is suggested to my mind by a summary inspection of what i see but it is not an exact expression in this case on the contrary graminaceous straw are rare to the great advantage of the future family which a we shall learn presently would find nothing to suit them in jointed plank what predominates is remnant of very small stalk light soft and rich in pith such a are possessed by various chicoriaceæ i recognize in particular the floral stem of the mouseear hawkweed and the nimes pterotheca next come bit of grassleaves scaly twig provided by the cypresstree and all sort of little stick coarse material adopted for the lack of anything better lastly if the favourite cylindrical piece fall short the mantle is sometimes finished off with an ample flounced tippet that is to say with fragment of dry leaf of any kind incomplete a it is this list show u that the caterpillar apart from his preference for pithy morsel ha no very exclusive taste he employ indifferently anything that he come upon provided that it be light very dry softened by long exposure to the air and of suitable dimension all his find if they come anywhere near his estimate are used just a they are without any alteration or sawing to reduce them to the proper length the psyche doe not trim the lath that go to form his roof he gather them a he find them his work is limited to imbricating them one after the other by fixing them at the foreend in order to lend itself to the movement of the journeying caterpillar and in particular to facilitate the action of the head and leg when a new piece is to be placed in position the front part of the sheath requires a special structure here a casing of beam is no longer allowable for their length and stiffness would hamper the artisan and even make his work impossible what is essential here is a flexible neck able to bend in all direction the assemblage of stake doe in fact end suddenly at some distance from the forepart and is there replaced by a collar in which the silken woof is merely hardened with very tiny ligneous particle tending to strengthen the material without impairing it flexibility this collar which give free movement is so important that all the psyche make equal use of it however much the rest of the work may differ all carry in front of the faggot of stick a yielding neck soft to the touch formed inside of a web of pure silk and velveted outside with a fine sawdust which the caterpillar obtains by crushing with his mandible any sort of dry straw a similar velvet but lustreless and faded apparently through age finish the sheath at the back in the form of a rather long bare appendix open at the end let u now remove the outside of the straw envelope shredding it piecemeal the demolition give u a varying number of joist i have counted a many a eighty and more the ruin that remains is a cylindrical sheath wherein we discover from one end to the other the structure which we perceived at the front and rear the two part which are naturally bare the tissue everywhere is of very stout silk which resists without breaking when pulled by the finger a smooth tissue beautifully white inside drab and wrinkled outside where it bristle with encrusted woody particle there will be an opportunity later to discover by what mean the caterpillar make himself so complicated a garment in which are laid one upon the other in a definite order first the extremely fine satin which is in direct contact with the skin next the mixed stuff a sort of frieze dusted with ligneous matter which save the silk and give consistency to the work lastly the surtout of overlapping lath while retaining this general threefold arrangement the scabbard offer notable variation of structural detail in the different specie here for instance is a second psyche 26 the most belated of the three which i have chanced to come upon i meet him towards the end of june hurrying across some dusty path near the house his case surpass those of the previous specie both in size and in regularity of arrangement they form a thick coverlet of many piece in which i recognize here fragment of hollow stalk there bit of fine straw with perhaps strap formed of blade of grass in front there is never any mantilla of dead leaf a troublesome piece of finery which without being in regular use is pretty frequent in the costume of the firstnamed specie at the back no long denuded vestibule save for the indispensable collar at the aperture all the rest is cased in log there is not much variety about the thing but when all is said there is a certain elegance in it stern faultlessness the smallest in size and simplest in dress is the third 27 who is very common at the end of winter on the wall a well a in the furrow of the bark of gnarled old tree be they olivetrees holmoaks elm or almost any other his case a modest little bundle is hardly more than twofifths of an inch in length a dozen rotten straw gleaned at random and fixed close to one another in a parallel direction represent with the silk sheath his whole outlay on dress it would be difficult to clothe one self more economically this pigmy apparently so uninteresting shall supply u with our first record of the curious lifestory of the psyche i gather him in profusion in april and instal him in a wire belljar what he eats i know not my ignorance would be grievous under other condition but at present i need not trouble about provision taken from their wall and tree where they had suspended themselves for their transformation most of my little psyche are in the chrysalis state a few of them are still active they hasten to clamber to the top of the trelliswork they fix themselves there perpendicularly by mean of a little silk cushion then everything is still june come to an end and the male moth are hatched leaving the chrysalid wrapper half caught in the case which remains fixed where it is and will remain there indefinitely until dismantled by the weather the emergence is effected through the hinder end of the bundle of stick the only way by which it can be effected having permanently closed the top opening the real door of the house by fastening it to the support which he ha chosen the caterpillar therefore ha turned the other way round and undergone his transformation in a reversed position which enables the adult insect to emerge through the outlet made at the back the only one now free for that matter this is the method followed by all the psyche the case ha two aperture the front one which is more regular and more carefully constructed is at the caterpillar service so long a larval activity last it is closed and firmly fastened to it support at the time of the nymphosis the hinder one which is faulty and even hidden by the sagging of the side is at the moth service it doe not really open until right at the end when pushed by the chrysalis or the adult insect in their modest pearlgrey dress with their insignificant wingequipment hardly exceeding that of a common fly our little moth are still not without elegance they have handsome feathery plume for antennæ their wing are edged with delicate fringe they whirl very fussily inside the belljar they skim the ground fluttering their wing they crowd eagerly around certain sheath which nothing on the outside distinguishes from the others they alight upon them and sound them with their plume this feverish agitation mark them a lover in search of their bride this one here that one there each of them find his mate but the coy one doe not leave her home thing happen very discreetly through the wicket left open at the free end of the case the male stand on the threshold of this backdoor for a little while and then it is over the wedding is finished there is no need for u to linger over these nuptials in which the party concerned do not know do not see each other i hasten to place in a glass tube the few case in which the mysterious event have happened some day later the recluse come out of the sheath and show herself in all her wretchedness call that little fright a moth one can not easily get used to the idea of such poverty the caterpillar of the start wa no humblerlooking there are no wing none at all no silky fur either at the tip of the abdomen a round tufty pad a crown of dirtywhite velvet on each segment in the middle of the back a large rectangular dark patch these are the sole attempt at ornament the mother psyche renounces all the beauty which her name of moth promised from the centre of the hairy coronet a long ovipositor stand out consisting of two part one stiff forming the base of the implement the other soft and flexible sheathed in the first just a a telescope fit in it tube the laying mother bend herself into a hook grip the lower end of her case with her six foot and drive her probe into the backwindow a window which serf manifold purpose allowing of the consummation of the clandestine marriage the emergence of the fertilized bride the installation of the egg and lastly the exodus of the young family there at the free end of her case the mother remains for a long time bowed and motionless what can she be doing in this contemplative attitude she is lodging her egg in the house which she ha just left she is bequeathing the maternal cottage to her heir some thirty hour pas and the ovipositor is at last withdrawn the laying is finished a little wadding supplied by the coronet on the hindquarter close the door and allays the danger of invasion the fond mother make a barricade for her brood of the sole ornament which in her extreme indigence she posse better still she make a rampart of her body bracing herself convulsively on the threshold of her home she dy there dry up there devoted to her family even after death it need an accident a breath of air to make her fall from her post let u now open the case it contains the chrysalid wrapper intact except for the front breach through which the psyche emerged the male because of his wing and his plume very cumbersome article when he is about to make his way through the narrow pas take advantage of his chrysalis state to make a start for the door and come out halfway then bursting his amber tunic the delicate moth find an open space where flight is possible right in front of him the mother unprovided with wing and plume is not compelled to observe any such precaution her cylindrical form bare and differing but little from that of the caterpillar allows her to crawl to slip into the narrow passage and to come forth without obstacle her cast chrysalid skin is therefore left right at the back of the case well covered by the thatched roof and this is an act of prudence marked by exquisite tenderness the egg in fact are packed in the barrel in the parchmentlike wallet formed by the slough the mother ha thrust her telescopic ovipositor to the bottom of that receptacle and ha methodically gone on laying until it is full not satisfied with bequeathing her home and her velvet coronet to her offspring a a last sacrifice she leaf them her skin with a view to observing at my ease the event which are soon to happen i extract one of these chrysalid bag stuffed with egg from it faggot and place it by itself beside it case in a glass tube i have not long to wait in the first week of july i find myself all of a sudden in possession of a large family the quickness of the hatching balked my watchfulness the newborn caterpillar about forty in number have already had time to garb themselves they wear a persian headdress a mages tiara in dazzling white plush or to abandon highflown language let u say a cotton nightcap without a tassel only the cap doe not stand up from the head it cover the hindquarter great animation reign in the tube which is a spacious residence for such vermin they roam about gaily with their cap sticking up almost perpendicular to the floor with a tiara like that and thing to eat life must be sweet indeed but what do they eat i try a little of everything that grows on the bare stone and the gnarled old tree nothing is welcomed more eager to dress than to feed themselves the psyche scorn what i set before them my ignorance a an insectbreeder will not matter provided that i succeed in seeing with what material and in what manner the first outline of the cap are woven i may fairly hope to achieve this ambition a the chrysalid bag is far from having exhausted it content i find in it teeming amid the rumpled wrapper of the egg an additional family a numerous a the swarm that is already out the total laying must therefore amount to five or six dozen i transfer to another receptacle the precocious band which is already dressed and keep only the naked laggard in the tube they have bright red head with the rest of their body dirty white and they measure hardly a twentyfifth of an inch in length my patience is not long put to the test next day little by little singly or in group the belated grub quit the chrysalid bag they come out without breaking the frail wallet through the front breach made by the liberation of the mother not one of them utilizes it a a dressmaterial though it ha the delicacy and amber colouring of an onionskin nor do any of them make use of a fine quilting which line the inside of the bag and form an exquisitely soft bed for the egg this down whose origin we shall have to investigate presently ought one would say to make an excellent blanket for these chilly one impatient to cover themselves up not a single one us it there would not be enough to go round all go straight to the coarse faggot which i left in contact with the wallet that wa the chrysalis time press before making your entrance into the world and going agrazing you must first be clad all therefore with equal fury attack the old sheath and hastily dress themselves in the mother cast clothes some turn their attention to bit that happen to be open lengthwise and scrape the soft white inner layer others greatly daring penetrate into the tunnel of a hollow stalk and go and collect their cotton good in the dark at such time the material are firstclass and the garment woven is of a dazzling white others bite deep into the piece which they select and make themselves a motley garment in which darkcoloured particle mar the snowy whiteness of the rest the tool which they use for their gleaning consists of the mandible shaped like wide shear with five strong teeth apiece the two plane fit into each other and form an implement capable of seizing and slicing any fibre however small seen under the microscope it is a wonderful specimen of mechanical precision and power were the sheep similarly equipped in proportion to her size she would browse upon the bottom of the tree instead of cropping the grass a very instructive workshop is that of the psychevermin toiling to make themselves a cotton nightcap there are number of thing to remark in both the finish of the work and the ingenuity of the method employed to avoid repeating ourselves we will say nothing about these yet but wait for a little and return to the subject when setting forth the talent of a second psyche of larger stature and easier to observe the two weaver observe exactly the same procedure nevertheless let u take a glance at the bottom of the eggcup a general workyard in which i instal my dwarf a the case turn them out there are some hundred of them with the sheath from which they came and an assortment of clipped stalk chosen from among the driest and richest in pith what a whirl what bewildering animation in order to see man micromégas cut himself a lens out of a diamond of his necklace he held his breath lest the storm from his nostril should blow the mite away i in my turn will be the good giant newly arriving from sirius i screw a magnifyingglass into my eye and am careful not to breathe for fear of overturning and sweeping out of existence my cottonworkers if i need one of them to focus him under a stronger glass i lime him a it were seizing him with the fine point of a needle which i have passed over my lip taken away from his work the tiny caterpillar struggle at the end of the needle shrivels up make himself small a he is still smaller he strives to withdraw a far a possible into his clothing which a yet is incomplete the merest flannel vest or even a narrow scarf covering nothing but the top of his shoulder let u leave him to complete his coat i give a puff and the creature is swallowed up in the crater of the eggcup and this speck is alive it is industrious it is versed in the art of blanketmaking an orphan born that moment it know how to cut itself out of it dead mother old clothes the wherewithal to clothe itself in it turn soon it will become a carpenter an assembler of timber to make a defensive covering for it delicate fabric what must instinct be to be capable of awakening such industry in an atom it is at the end of june also that i obtain in his adult shape the psyche whose scabbard is continued underneath by a long naked vestibule most of the case are fastened by a silk pad to the trelliswork of the cage and hang vertically like stalactite some few of them have never left the ground half immersed in the sand they stand erect with their rear in the air and their forepart buried and firmly anchored to the side of the pan by mean of a silky paste this inverted position excludes any idea of weight a a guide in the caterpillar preparation an adept at turning round in his cabin he is careful before he sink into the immobility of pupadom to turn his head now upwards now downwards towards the opening so that the adult insect which is much le free than the larva in it movement may reach the outside without obstacle moreover it is the pupa itself the unbending chrysalis incapable of turning and obliged to move all in one piece which stubbornly crawling carry the male to the threshold of the case it emerges half way at the end of the uncovered silky vestibule and there break obstructing the opening with it slough a it doe so for a time the moth stand still on the roof of the cottage allowing his humour to evaporate his wing to spread and gather strength then at last the gallant take flight in search of her for whose sake he ha made himself so spruce he wear a costume of deepest black all except the edge of the wing which having no scale remain diaphanous his antennæ likewise black are wide and graceful plume were they on a larger scale they would throw the feathered beauty of the marabou and ostrich into the shade the bravely beplumed one visit case after case in his tortuous flight prying into the secret of those alcove if thing go a he wish he settle with a quick flutter of his wing on the extremity of the denuded vestibule come the wedding a discreet a that of the smaller psyche here is yet another who doe not see or at most catch a fleeting glimpse of her for whose sake he ha donned maraboufeathers and a blackvelvet cloak the recluse on her side is equally impatient the lover are shortlived they die in my cage within three or four day so that for long interval until the hatching of some latecomer the female population is short of suitor so when the morning sun already hot strike the cage a very singular spectacle is repeated many time before my eye the entrance to the vestibule swell imperceptibly open and emits a mass of infinitely delicate down a spider web carded and made into wadding would give nothing of such gossamer fineness it is a vaporous cloud then from out of this incomparable eiderdown appear the head and forepart of a very different sort of caterpillar from the original collector of straw it is the mistress of the house the marriageable moth who feeling her hour about to come and failing to receive the expected visit herself make the advance and go a far a she can to meet her plumed swain he doe not come hastening up and for good reason there is not a male left in the establishment for two or three hour the poor forsaken one lean without moving from her window then tired of waiting very gently she go indoors again backwards and return to her cell next day the day after and later still a long a her strength permit she reappears on her balcony always in the morning in the soft ray of a warm sun and always on a sofa of that incomparable down which disperses and turn to vapour if i merely fan it with my hand again no one come for the last time the disappointed moth go back to her boudoir never to leave it again she dy in it dry up a useless thing i hold my belljars responsible for this crime against motherhood in the open field without a doubt sooner or later wooer would have appeared coming from the four wind the said belljars have an even more pitiful catastrophe on their conscience sometimes leaning too far from her window miscalculating the balance between the front of the body which is at liberty and the back which remains sheathed in it case the moth allows herself to drop to the ground it is all up now with the fallen one and her lineage still there is one good thing about it accident such a this lay bare the mother psyche without our having to break into her house what a miserable creature she is a great deal uglier than the original caterpillar here transfiguration spell disfigurement progress mean retrogression what we have before our eye is a wrinkled satchel an earthyyellow sausage and this horror worse than a maggot is a moth in the full bloom of life a genuine adult moth she is the betrothed of the elegant black bombyx all plumed with maraboufeathers and represents to him the last word in beauty a the proverb say beauty lie in lover eye a profound truth which the psyche confirms in striking fashion let u describe the ugly little sausage a very small head a paltry globule disappearing almost entirely in the fold of the first segment what need is there of cranium and brain for a germbag and so the tiny creature almost doe without them reduces them to the simplest expression nevertheless there are two black ocular speck do these vestigial eye see their way about not very clearly we may be sure the pleasure of light must be very small for this stayathome who appears at her window only on rare occasion when the male moth is late in arriving the leg are wellshaped but so short and weak that they are of no use at all for locomotion the whole body is a pale yellow semitransparent in front opaque and stuffed with egg behind underneath the first segment is a sort of neckband that is to say a dark stain the vestige of a crop showing through the skin a pad of short down end the oviferous part at the back it is all that remains of a fleece of a thin velvet which the insect rub off a it move backwards and forward in it narrow lodging this form the flaky mass which whitens the trystingwindow at the weddingtime and also line the inside of the sheath with down in short the creature is little more than a bag swollen with egg for the best part of it length i know nothing lower in the scale of wretchedness the germbag move but not of course with those vestige of leg which form too short and feeble support it get about in a way that allows it to progress on it back belly or side indifferently a groove is hollowed out at the hinder end of the bag a deep dividing groove which cut the insect into two it run to the front part spreading like a wave and gently and slowly reach the head this undulation constitutes a step when it is done the animal ha advanced about a twentyfifth part of an inch to go from one end to the other of a box two inch long and filled with fine sand the living sausage take nearly an hour it is by crawling like this that it move about in it case when it come to the threshold to meet it visitor and go in again for three or four day exposed to the roughness of the soil the oviferous bag lead a wretched life creeping about at random or more often standing still no moth pay attention to the poor thing who posse no attraction outside her home the lover pas by with an indifferent air this coolness is logical enough why should she become a mother if her family is to be abandoned to the inclemency of the public way and so after falling by accident from her case which would have been the cradle of the youngster the wanderer withers in a few day and dy childless the fertilized onesand these are the more numerousthe prudent one who have saved themselves from a fall by being le lavish with their appearance at the window reenter the sheath and do not show themselves again once the moth visit to the threshold is over let u wait a fortnight and then open the case lengthwise with our scissors at the end in the widest part opposite the vestibule is the slough of the chrysalis a long fragile ambercoloured sack open at the end that contains the head the end facing the exitpassage in this sack which she fill like a mould lie the mother the eggbladder now giving no sign of life from this amber sheath which present all the usual characteristic of a chrysalis the adult psyche emerged in the guise of a shapeless moth looking like a big maggot at the present time she ha slipped back into her old jacket moulding herself into it in such a way that it becomes difficult to separate the container from the content one would take the whole thing for a single body it seems very likely that this cast skin which occupies the best place in the home formed the psyche refuge when weary of waiting on the threshold of her hall she retired to the back room she ha therefore gone in and out repeatedly this constant going and coming this continual rubbing against the side of a narrow corridor just wide enough for her to pas through ended by stripping her of her down she had a fleece to start with a very light and scanty fleece it is true but still a vestige of the costume which moth are wont to wear this fluff she ha lost what ha she done with it the eider robs herself of her down to make a luxurious bed for her brood the newborn rabbit lie on a mattress which their mother card for them with the softest part of her fur shorn from the belly and neck wherever the shear of her front teeth can reach it this fond tenderness is shared by the psyche a you will see in front of the chrysalid bag is an abundant mass of extrafine wadding similar to that of which a few flock used to fall outside on the occasion when the recluse went to her window is it silk is it spun muslin no but it is something of incomparable delicacy the microscope recognizes it a the scaly dust the impalpable down in which every moth is clad to give a snug shelter to the little caterpillar who will soon be swarming in the case to provide them with a refuge in which they can play about and gather strength before entering the wide world the psyche ha stripped herself of her fur like the mother rabbit this denudation may be a mere mechanical result an unintentional effect of repeated rubbing against the lowroofed wall but there is nothing to tell u so maternity ha it foresight even among the humblest i therefore picture the hairy moth twisting about going to and fro in the narrow passage in order to get rid of the fleece and prepare bedding for her offspring it is even possible that she manages to use her lip that vestige of a mouth in order to pull out the down that refuse to come away of itself no matter what the method of shearing may be a mound of scale and hair fill up the case in front of the chrysalid bag for the moment it is a barricade preventing access to the house which is open at the hinder end soon it will be a downy couch on which the little caterpillar will rest for a while after leaving the egg here warmly ensconced in a rug of extreme softness they call a halt a a preparation for the emergence and the work that follows it not that silk is lacking on the contrary it abounds the caterpillar lavished it during his time a a spinner and a pickerup of straw the whole interior of the case is padded with thick white satin but how greatly preferable to this toocompact and luxurious upholstery is the delightful eiderdown bedding of the newborn youngster we know the preparation made for the coming family now where are the egg at what spot are they laid the smallest of my three psyche who is le misshapen than the others and freer in her movement leaf her case altogether she posse a long ovipositor and insert it through the exithole right into the chrysalid slough which is left where it wa in the form of a bag this slough receives the laying when the operation is finished and the bag of egg is full the mother dy outside hanging on to the case the two other psyche who do not carry telescopic ovipositor and whose only method of changing their position is a dubious sort of crawling have more singular custom to show u one might quote with regard to them what used to be said of the roman matron those model mother domi mansit lanam fecit yes lanam fecit the psyche doe not really work the wool on the distaff but at least she bequeathes to her son her own fleece converted into a heap of wadding yes domi mansit she never leaf her house not even for her wedding not even for the purpose of laying her egg we have seen how after receiving the visit of the male the shapeless moth that uncouth sausage retreat to the back of her case and withdraws into her chrysalid slough which she fill exactly just a though she had never left it the egg are in their place then and there they occupy the regulation sack favoured by the various psyche of what use would a laying be now strictly speaking there is none in fact that is to say the egg do not leave the mother womb the living pouch which ha engendered them keep them within itself soon this bag loses it moisture by evaporation it dry up and at the same time remains sticking to the chrysalid wrapper that firm support let u open the thing what doe the magnifyingglass show u a few trachean thread lean bundle of muscle nervous ramification in short the relic of a form of vitality reduced to it simplest expression taken all around very nearly nothing the rest of the content is a mass of egg an agglomeration of germ numbering close upon three hundred in a word the insect is one enormous ovary assisted by just so much a enables it to perform it function the psyche the case the hatching of the egg take place in the first fortnight of july the little grub measure about one twentyfifth of an inch their head and the upper part of the first thoracic segment are a glossy black the next two segment brownish and the rest of the body a pale amber sharp lively little creature who run about with short quick step they swarm all over the spongy hairy tissue resulting from the castoff clothing of the egg the book tell me that the little psyche begin by eating up their mother a loathsome banquet for which the said book must accept responsibility i see nothing of the sort and i do not even understand how the idea arose the mother bequeaths to her son her case whose straw are searched for wadding the material of the first coat out of her chrysalid slough and her skin she make them a twofold shelter for the hatchingtime with her down she prepares a defensive barricade for them and a place wherein to wait before emerging thus all is given all spent with a view to the future save for some thin dry strip which my lens can only with difficulty distinguish there is nothing left that could provide a cannibal feast for so numerous a family no my little psyche you do not eat your mother in vain do i watch you never either to clothe or to feed himself doe any one of you lay a tooth upon the remains of the deceased the maternal skin is left untouched a are those other insignificant relic the layer of muscular tissue and the network of airducts the sack left behind by the chrysalis also remains intact the time come to quit the natal wallet an outlet ha been contrived long beforehand saving the youngster from committing any act of violence against what wa once their mother there is no sacrilegious cutting to be done with the shear the door open of itself when she wa a wriggling speck of sausage the mother front segment were remarkably translucent forming a contrast with the rest of the body this wa very probably a sign of a le dense and le tough texture than elsewhere the sign is not misleading the dry gourd to which the mother is now reduced ha for a neck those diaphanous ring which a they withered became extremely fragile doe this neck this operculum fall of it own accord or is it pushed off by the pigmy impatient to get away i do not know for certain this however i can say that blowing on it is enough to make it drop off in anticipation therefore of the emergence an exceedingly easy and perhaps even spontaneous method of decapitation is prepared in the mother lifetime to manufacture a delicate neck for yourself so that you may be easily beheaded at the proper time and thus leave the way free to the youngster is an act of devotion in which the most unconscious maternal affection stand sublimely revealed that miserable maggot that sausage moth scarce able to crawl and yet so clearsighted where the future is concerned stagger the mind of any one who know how to think the brood emerge from the natal wallet through the window just opened by the fall of the head the chrysalid sack the second wrapper present no obstacle it ha remained open since the adult psyche left it next come the mass of eiderdown the heap of fluff of which the mother stripped herself here the little caterpillar stop much more spaciously and comfortably lodged than in the bag whence they have come some take a rest others bustle about exercise themselves in walking all pick up strength in preparation for their exodus into the daylight they do not stay long amid this luxury gradually a they gain vigour they come out and spread over the surface of the case work begin at once a very urgent work that of the wardrobe the first mouthful will come afterwards when we are dressed montaigne when putting on the cloak which his father had worn before him used a touching expression he said i dress myself in my father the young psyche in the same way dress themselves in their mother they cover themselves with the clothes left behind by the deceased they scrape from it the wherewithal to make themselves a cotton frock the material employed is the pith of the little stalk especially of the piece which split lengthwise are more easily stripped of their content the grub first find a spot to suit it having done so it gleans it plane with it mandible thus a superbly white wadding is extracted from old log the manner of beginning the garment is worth noting the tiny creature employ a judicious a method a any which our own industry could hope to discover the wadding is collected in infinitesimal pellet how are these little particle to be fixed a and when they are detached by the shear of the mandible the manufacturer need a support a base and this support can not be obtained on the caterpillar own body for any adherence would be seriously embarrassing and would hamper freedom of movement the difficulty is overcome very cleverly scrap of plush are gathered and by degree fastened to one another with thread of silk this form a sort of rectilinear garland in which the particle collected swing from a common rope when these preparation are deemed sufficient the little creature pass the garland round it waist at about the third segment of the thorax so a to leave it six leg free then it tie the two end with a bit of silk the result is a girdle generally incomplete but soon completed with other scrap fastened to the silk ribbon that carry everything this girdle is the base of the work the support henceforth to lengthen the piece to enlarge it into the perfect garment the grub ha only to fix always at the foreedge with the aid of it spinnerets now at the top now at the bottom or side the scrap of pith which the mandible never cease extracting nothing could be better thought out than this initial garland laid out flat and then buckled like a belt around the loin once this base is laid the weavingloom is in full swing the piece woven is first a tiny string around the waist next by the addition of fresh pellet always at the foreedge it grows into a scarf a waistcoat a short jacket and lastly a sack which gradually make it way backwards not of itself but through the action of the weaver who slip forward in the part of the case already made in a few hour the garment is completed it is by that time a conical hood a cloak of magnificent whiteness and finish we now know all about it on leaving the maternal hut without searching without distant expedition which would be so dangerous at that age the little psyche find in the tender beam of the roof the wherewithal to clothe himself he is spared the peril of roaming in a state of nudity when he leaf the house he will be quite warm thanks to the mother who take care to instal her family in the old case and give it choice material to work with if the grubworm were to drop out of the hovel if some gust of wind swept him to a distance most often the poor mite would be lost ligneous straw rich in pith dry and retted to a turn are not to be found everywhere it would mean the impossibility of any clothing and in that dire poverty an early death but if suitable material are encountered equal in quality to those bequeathed by the mother how is it that the exile is unable to make use of them let u look into this i segregate a few newborn grub in a glass tube and give them for their material some split piece of straw picked from among the old stalk of a sort of dandelion pterotheca nemausensis though robbed of the inheritance of the maternal manor the grub seem very well satisfied with my bit without the least hesitation they scrape out of them a superb white pith and make it into a delicious cloak much handsomer than that which they would have obtained with the ruin of the native house this latter cloak being always more or le flawed with darker material whose colour ha been impaired by long exposure to the air on the other hand the nîmes dandelion a relic of last spring ha it central part which i myself lay bare a spotless white and the cotton nightcap achieves the very perfection of whiteness i obtain an even better result with round of sorghumpith taken from the kitchenbroom this time the work ha glittering crystalline point and look like a thing built of grain of sugar it is my manufacturer masterpiece these two success authorize me to vary the raw material still further in the absence of newborn caterpillar who are not always at my disposal i employ grub which i have undressed that is to say which i have taken out of their cap to these divested one i give a the only thing to work upon a strip of paper free from paste and easy to pick to piece in short a piece of blottingpaper here again there is no hesitation the grub lustily scrape this surface new to them though it be and make themselves a paper coat of it cadet roussel 28 of famous memory had a coat of similar stuff but much le fine and silky my paperclad charge are so wellpleased with their material that they scorn their native case when it is afterwards placed at their disposal and continue to scrape lint from the industrial product others are given nothing in their tube but are able to get at the cork that close the glass dwellinghouse this is enough the undraped one hasten to scrape the cork to break it into atom and out of these to make themselves a granulated frock a faultlessly elegant a though their race had always made use of this material the novelty of the stuff employed perhaps for the first time ha made no change in the cut of the coat to sum up they accept any vegetable matter that is dry light and not too resistant would they behave likewise towards animal material and especially mineral material on condition that these are of a suitable thinness i take a great peacock wing left over from my experiment in the nuptial telegraphy of this moth 29 and cut from it a strip on which i place at the bottom of a tube two little caterpillar stripped of their clothing the two prisoner have nothing else at their disposal any drapery that they want must be got out of this scaly expanse they hesitate for a long time in the presence of that strange carpet in twentyfour hour time one of the caterpillar ha started no work and seems resolved to let himself die naked a he is the other stouterhearted or perhaps le injured by the brutal strippingprocess explores the slip for a little while and at last resolve to make use of it before the day is over he ha clothed himself in grey velvet out of the great peacock scale considering the delicacy of the material the work is exquisitely correct let u go a step farther in our exploration for the soft yielding wadding collected from a plant or the down gleaned from the wing of a moth we will substitute rough stone in their final state i know the psyche case are often laden with grain of sand and earthy particle but these are accidental brick which have been inadvertently touched by the spinneret and incorporated unintentionally in the thatch the delicate creature know too well the drawback of a pebbly pillow to seek the support of stone mineral matter is distasteful to them and it is mineral matter that now ha to be worked like wool true i select such stone in my collection a are least out of keeping with the feeble power of my grub i posse a specimen of flaky hematite at the merest touch of a hairpencil it break into atom almost a minute a the dust which a butterfly wing leaf on our finger on a bed of this material which glitter like a steel filing i establish four young caterpillar extracted from their clothing i foresee a check in this experiment and consequently increase the number of my subject it is a i thought the day pass and the four caterpillar remain bare next day however one one alone decides to clothe himself his work is a tiara with metallic facet in which the light play with flash of every colour of the rainbow it is very rich very sumptuous but mightily heavy and cumbrous walking becomes laborious under that load of metal even so must a byzantine emperor have progressed at ceremony of state after donning his goldworked dalmatic poor little creature more sensible than man you did not select that ridiculous magnificence of your own free will it wa i who forced it on you here to make amends is a disk of sorghumpith fling off your proud tiara thrust it from you quickly and place in it stead a cotton nightcap which is much healthier this is done on the second day the psyche ha his favourite material when starting a a manufacturer a vegetable lint collected from any ligneous scrap well softened by the air a lint usually supplied by the old roof of the maternal hut in the absence of the regulation fabric he is able to make use of animal velvet in particular of the scaly fluff of a moth in case of necessity he doe not shrink from act of sheer madness he weave mineral matter so urgent is his need to clothe himself this need outweighs that of nourishment i take a young caterpillar from his grazingground a leaf of very hairy hawkweed which after many attempt i have found to suit him a food because of it green blade and a wool because of it white fleece i take him i say from his refectory and leave him to fast for a couple of day then i strip him and put him back on his leaf and i see him unmindful of eating in spite of his long fast first labouring to make himself a new coat by collecting the hair of the hawkweed his appetite will be satisfied afterwards is he then so susceptible to cold we are in the midst of the dogdays the sun shoot down a fiery torrent that brings the wild concert of the cicadæ up to feverpitch in the baking heat of the study where i am questioning my animal i have flung off hat and necktie and am working in my shirtsleeve and in this oven what the psyche clamour for is above all thing a warm covering well little shiverer i will satisfy you i expose him to the direct ray of the sun on the windowledge this time it is too much of a good thing i have gone beyond all bound the sunscorched one wriggle about flourish his abdomen always a sign of discomfort but the making of the hawkweed cassock is not suspended on this account on the contrary it is pursued more hurriedly than ever could this be because of the excessive light is not the cottonwool bag a retreat wherein the caterpillar isolates himself sheltering from the importunity of broad daylight and gently digest and sleep let u get rid of the light while retaining a warm temperature after a preliminary stripping the little caterpillar are now lodged in a cardboard box which i place in the sunniest corner of my window the temperature here is well over 100 f no matter the swansdown sack is remade at a sitting of a few hour tropical heat and the quiet that go with darkness have made no difference in the insect habit neither the degree of heat nor the degree of light explains the pressing need of raiment where are we to seek the reason for that hurry to get clad i can see none save a presentiment of the future the psyche caterpillar ha the winter before him he know nothing of a common shelter in a silken purse of cabin among closetouching leaf of underground cell of retreat under old cracked bark of hairy roof of cocoon in short of the different method employed by other caterpillar to protect themselves against the severity of the weather he ha to spend the winter exposed to the inclemency of the air this peril cause his particular talent he build himself a roof whose imbricated and diverging stalk will allow cold dew and drop of melted snow to trickle away at a distance when the case is fixed and hanging vertically under this covering he weave a thick silk lining which will make a soft mattress and a rampart against the effect of the cold once these precaution are taken the winter may come and the north wind rage the psyche is sleeping peacefully in his hut but all this is not improvised a the stormy season approach it is a delicate work which take time to carry out all his lifelong the caterpillar labour at it improving it adding to it strengthening it incessantly and in order to acquire greater skill he begin his apprenticeship at the moment when he leaf the egg a preliminary practice for the thick overcoat of fullgrown age he try his hand on cotton cape even so doe the pine processionary a soon a hatched weave first delicate tent then gauzy cupola a harbinger of the mighty wallet in which the community will make it home both alike are harassed from the day of their birth by the presentiment of the future they start life by binding themselves apprentice to the trade that is to safeguard them one day no the psyche is not more sensitive to cold than any other smoothskinned caterpillar he is a creature of foresight deprived in winter of the shelter granted to the others he prepares himself from his birth for the building of a home that will be his salvation and practises for it by making frippery of wadding suited to his strength he foresees the rigour of winter during the blazing dogdays they are now all clad my young caterpillar numbering nearly a thousand they wander restlessly in large glass receptacle closed with a sheet of glass what do you seek little one swinging your pretty snowwhite cloak a you go food of course after all that fatigue you need refreshment despite your number you will not be too heavy a burden on my resource you can manage with so little but what do you ask for you certainly do not count on me for your supply in the open field you would have found victual to your liking much more easily than i can hope to find them for you since my wish to know all about you place you in my charge i have a duty which i must observe that of feeding you what do you want the part of providence is a very difficult one to play the purveyor of foodstuff thinking of the morrow taking his precaution so that the home may be always more or le supplied performs the most deserving but also the most laborious of function the little one wait trustingly persuaded that thing happen of themselves while he anxiously resort to every kind of ingenuity and trouble wondering whether the right thing will come ah how well long practice ha taught me to know the trade with all it worry and all it joy behold me today the providence of a thousand nurseling thrust upon me by my study i try a little of everything the tender leaf of the elm appear to suit if i serve them up one day i find them next morning nibbled on the surface in small patch tiny grain of impalpable black dust scattered here and there tell me that the intestine have been at work this give me a moment of satisfaction which will be readily understood by any breeder of a herd whose diet is unknown the hope of success gain strength i know how to feed my vermin have i discovered the best method at the first attempt i dare not think so i continue therefore to vary the fare but the result hardly come up to my wish the flock refuse my assorted green stuff and even end by taking a dislike to the elmleaves i am beginning to believe that i have failed utterly when a happy inspiration occurs to me i have recognized among the bit that go to form the case a few fragment of the mouseear hawkweed hieracium pilosella so the psyche frequents that plant why should he not browse it let u try the mouseear display it little round flower in profusion in a stony field just beside my house at the foot of the wall where i have so often found psychecases hanging i gather a handful and distribute it among my different fold this time the foodproblem is solved the psyche forthwith settle in solid mass on the hairy leaf and nibble at them greedily in small patch in which the epidermis of the other surface remains untouched we will leave them to their grazing with which they seem quite satisfied and ask ourselves a certain question relating to cleanliness how doe the little psyche get rid of his digestive refuse remember that he is enclosed in a sack one dare not entertain the thought of ordure ejected and accumulating at the far end of the dazzling white plush cap filth can not dwell under so elegant a covering how is the sordid evacuation managed despite the fact that it end in a conical point in which the lens reveals no break of continuity the sack is not closed at the hinder end it method of manufacture by mean of a waistband whose foreedge increase in dimension in proportion a the rearedge is pushed farther back prof this sufficiently the hinder end becomes pointed simply owing to the shrinking of the material which contract of itself at the part where the caterpillar decreasing diameter no longer distends it there is thus at the point a permanent hole whose lip remain closed the caterpillar ha only to go a little way back and the stuff expands the hole widens the road is open and the excretion fall to the ground on the other hand so soon a the caterpillar take a step forward into his case the rubbishshoot close of itself it is a very simple and very ingenious mechanism a good a anything contrived by our seamstress to cope with the shortcoming of a boy first pair of breech meanwhile the grub grows and it tunic continues to fit it is neither too large nor too small but just the right size how is this done if the textbook were to be credited i might expect to see the caterpillar split his sheath lengthwise when it became too tight and afterwards enlarge it by mean of a piece woven between the edge of the rent that is what our tailor do but it is not the psyche method at all they know something much better they keep on working at their coat which is old at the back new in front and always a perfect fit for the growing body nothing is easier than to watch the daily progress in size a few caterpillar have just made themselves a hood of sorghumpith the work is perfectly beautiful it might have been woven out of snowflake i isolate these smartlydressed one and give them a weavingmaterials some brown scale chosen from the softest part that i can find in old bark between morning and evening the hood assumes a new appearance the tip of the cone is still a spotless white but all the front part is coarse drapery very different in colouring from the original plush next day the sorghum felt ha wholly disappeared and is replaced from one end of the cone to the other by a frieze of bark i then take away the brown material and put sorghumpith in their stead this time the coarse dark stuff retreat gradually towards the top of the hood while the soft white stuff gain in width starting from the mouth before the day is over the original elegant mitre will be reconstructed entirely this alternation can be repeated a often a we please indeed by shortening each period of work we can easily obtain with the two sort of material composite product showing alternate light and dark belt the psyche a you see in no way follows the method of our tailor with their piece taken out and another piece let in in order to have a coat always to his size he never cease working at it the particle collected are constantly being fixed just at the edge of the sack so that the new drapery increase progressively in dimension keeping pace with the caterpillar growth at the same time the old stuff recedes is driven back towards the tip of the cone here through it own springiness it contract and close the muff any surplus matter disintegrates fall into shred and gradually disappears a the insect roams about and knock against the thing which it meet the case new at the front and old at the back is never too tight because it is always being renewed after the very hot period of the year there come a moment when light wrap are no longer seasonable autumnal rain threaten followed by winter frost it is time to make ourselves a thick greatcoat with a cape of thatch arranged in a series of waterproof tippet it begin with a great lack of accuracy straw of uneven length and bit of dry leaf are fastened with no attempt at order behind the neck of the sack which must still retain it flexibility so a to allow the caterpillar to bend freely in every direction few a yet rather short and placed anyhow sometimes lengthways and sometimes across these untidy first log of the roof will not interfere with the final regularity of the building they are destined to disappear and will be pushed back and be driven out at last a the sack grows in front later on when the piece are longer and betterchosen they are all carefully laid longitudinally the placing of a straw is done with surprising quickness and dexterity if the log which he ha found suit him the caterpillar take it between his leg and turn it round and round gripping it with his mandible by one end a a rule he remove a few morsel from this part and immediately fix them to the neck of the sack his object in laying bare the raw and rough surface to which the silk will stick better may be to obtain a firmer hold even so the plumber give a touch of the file at the point that is to be soldered then by sheer strength of jaw the caterpillar lift his beam brandish it in the air and with a quick movement of his rump lay it on his back the spinneret at once set to work on the end caught and the thing is done without any groping about or correcting the log is added to the others in the direction required the fine day of autumn are spent in toil of this kind performed leisurely and intermittently when the stomach is full by the time that the cold weather arrives the house is ready when the air is once more warm the psyche resume his walk abroad he roams along the path stroll over the friendly greensward take a few mouthful and then when the hour ha come prepares for his transformation by hanging from the wall these springtime wandering long after the case is completely finished made me want to know if the caterpillar would be capable of repeating his sackweaving and roofbuilding operation i take him out of his case and place him stark naked on a bed of fine dry sand i give him a material to work with some old stalk of nîmes dandelion cut up into stick of the same length a the piece that make the case the evicted insect disappears under the heap of ligneous straw and hurriedly start spinning taking a peg for it cord anything that it lip encounter the bed of sand underfoot the canopy of twig overhead so doing it bind together in extricable confusion all the piece touched by the spinneret long and short light and heavy at random in the centre of this tangled scaffolding a work is pursued of a quite different nature from that of hutbuilding the caterpillar weave and doe nothing else not even attempting to assemble into a proper roofing the material of which he is able to dispose the psyche owning a perfect case when he resume his activity with the fine weather scorn his old trade a an assembler of log a trade practised so zealously during the previous summer now that his stomach is satisfied and his silkglands distended he devotes his spare time solely to improving the quilting of his case the silky felt of the interior is never thick or soft enough to please him the thicker and softer it is the better for his own comfort during the process of transformation and for the safety of his family afterwards well my knavish trick have now robbed him of everything doe he perceive the disaster though the silk and timber at his disposal permit doe he dream of rebuilding the shelter so essential first to his chilly back and secondly to his family who will cut it up to make their first home not a bit of it he slip under the mass of twig where i let it fall and there begin to work exactly a he would have done under normal condition this shapeless roof and this sand on which the jumble of rafter are lying now represent to the psyche the wall of the regulation home and without in any way modifying his labour to meet the exigency of the moment the caterpillar upholsters the surface within his reach with the same zest that he would have displayed in adding new layer to the quilted lining which ha disappeared instead of being pasted on the proper wall the present hanging come in contact with the rough surface of the sand and the hopeless tangle of the straw and the spinner take no notice the house is worse than ruined it no longer exists no matter the caterpillar continues his actual work he loses sight of the real and upholsters the imaginary 30 and yet everything ought to apprise him of the absence of any roofing the sack with which he ha managed to cover himself very skilfully for that matter is lamentably flabby it sag and rumples at every movement of the insect body moreover it is made heavy with sand and bristle with spike in every direction which catch in the dust of the road and make all progress impossible thus anchored to the ground the caterpillar waste his strength in effort to shift his position it take him hour to make a start and to move his cumbrous dwelling a fraction of an inch with his normal case in which all the beam are imbricated from front to back with scientific precision he get along very nimbly his collection of log all fixed in front and all free at the back form a boatshaped sledge which slip and glide through obstacle without difficulty but though progress be easy retreat is impracticable for each piece of the framework cause the thing to stop owing to it free end well the sack of my victim is covered with lath pointing this way and that just in the position in which they happened to be caught by the spinneret a it fastened it thread here and there indiscriminately the bit in front are so many spur which dig into the sand and neutralize all effort to advance the bit at the side are rake whose resistance can not be overcome in such condition the insect is bound to be stranded and to perish on the spot if i were advising the caterpillar i should say go back to the art in which you excel arrange your bundle neatly point the cumbrous piece lengthwise in an orderly fashion do something to your sack which hang too loosely give it the necessary stiffness with a few prop to act a a busk do now in your distress what you knew so well how to do before summon up your old carpenteringtalents and you will be saved useless advice the time for carpentry is over the hour ha come for upholstering and he upholsters obstinately padding a house which no longer exists he will perish miserably cut up by the ant a the result of his toorigid instinct many other instance have already told u a much like running water which doe not climb slope and which doe not flow back to it source the insect never retraces it action what is done is done and can not be recommenced the psyche but now a clever carpenter will die for want of knowing how to fix a beam the great peacock it wa a memorable evening i shall call it the great peacock evening who doe not know the magnificent moth the largest in europe clad in maroon velvet with a necktie of white fur the wing with their sprinkling of grey and brown crossed by a faint zigzag and edged with smoky white have in the centre a round patch a great eye with a black pupil and a variegated iris containing successive black white chestnut and purple arc no le remarkable is the caterpillar in colour an undecided yellow on the top of thinlyscattered tubercle crowned with a palisade of black hair are set bead of turquoise blue his stout brown cocoon so curious with it exitshaft shaped like an eeltrap is usually fastened to the bark at the base of old almondtrees the caterpillar feed on the leaf of the same tree well on the morning of the 6th of may a female emerges from her cocoon in my presence on the table of my insectlaboratory i forthwith cloister her still damp with the humour of the hatching under a wiregauze belljar for the rest i cherish no particular plan i incarcerate her from mere habit the habit of the observer always on the lookout for what may happen it wa a lucky thought at nine oclock in the evening just a the household is going to bed there is a great stir in the room next to mine little paul halfundressed is rushing about jumping and stamping knocking the chair over like a mad thing i hear him call me come quick he scream come and see these moth big a bird the room is full of them i hurry in there is enough to justify the child enthusiastic and hyperbolical exclamation an invasion a yet unprecedented in our house a raid of giant moth four are already caught and lodged in a birdcage others more numerous are fluttering on the ceiling at this sight the prisoner of the morning is recalled to my mind put on your thing laddie i say to my son leave your cage and come with me we shall see something interesting we run downstairs to go to my study which occupies the right wing of the house in the kitchen i find the servant who is also bewildered by what is happening and stand flicking her apron at great moth whom she took at first for bat the great peacock it would seem ha taken possession of pretty well every part of the house what will it be around my prisoner the cause of this incursion luckily one of the two window of the study had been left open the approach is not blocked we enter the room candle in hand what we see is unforgetable with a soft flickflack the great moth fly around the belljar alight set off again come back fly up to the ceiling and down they rush at the candle putting it out with a stroke of their wing they descend on our shoulder clinging to our clothes grazing our face the scene suggests a wizard cave with it whirl of bat little paul hold my hand tighter than usual to keep up his courage how many of them are there about a score add to these the number that have strayed into the kitchen the nursery and the other room of the house and the total of those who have arrived from the outside can not fall far short of forty a i said it wa a memorable evening this great peacock evening coming from every direction and apprised i know not how here are forty lover eager to pay their respect to the marriageable bride born that morning amid the mystery of my study for the moment let u disturb the swarm of wooer no further the flame of the candle is a danger to the visitor who fling themselves into it madly and singe their wing we will resume the observation tomorrow with an experimental interrogatory thought out beforehand but first let u clear the ground and speak of what happens every night during the week that my observation last each time it is pitch dark between eight and ten oclock when the moth arrive one by one it is stormy weather the sky is very much overcast and the darkness is so profound that even in the open air in the garden far from the shadow of the tree it is hardly possible to see one hand before one face in addition to this darkness there is the difficulty of access the house is hidden by tall planetrees it is approached by a walk thickly bordered with lilac and rosetrees forming a sort of outer vestibule it is protected against the mistral by clump of pine and screen of cypress cluster of bushy shrub make a rampart a few step away from the door it is through this tangle of branch in complete darkness that the great peacock ha to tack about to reach the object of his pilgrimage under such condition the brown owl would not dare leave the hole in his olivetree the moth betterendowed with his faceted optical organ than the nightbird with it great eye go forward without hesitating and pass through without knocking against thing he directs his tortuous flight so skilfully that despite the obstacle overcome he arrives in a state of perfect freshness with his big wing intact with not a scratch upon him the darkness is light enough for him even if we grant that it perceives certain ray unknown to common retinæ this extraordinary power of sight can not be what warns the moth from afar and brings him hurrying to the spot the distance and the screen interposed make this quite impossible besides apart from deceptive refraction of which there is no question in this case the indication provided by light are so precise that we go straight to the thing seen now the moth sometimes blunder not a to the general direction which he is to take but a to the exact spot where the interesting event are happening i have said that the childrens nursery which is at the side of the house opposite my study the real goal of my visitor at the present moment wa occupied by the moth before i went there with a light in my hand these certainly were illinformed there wa the same throng of hesitating visitor in the kitchen but here the light of a lamp that irresistible lure to nocturnal insect may have beguiled the eager one let u consider only the place that were in the dark in these there are several stray moth i find them more or le everywhere around the actual spot aimed at for instance when the captive is in my study the visitor do not all enter by the open window the safe and direct road only two or three yard away from the caged prisoner several of them come in downstairs wander about the hall and at most reach the staircase a blind alley barred at the top by a closed door these data tell u that the guest at this nuptial feast do not make straight for their object a they would if they derived their information from some kind of luminous radiation whether known or unknown to our physical science it is something else that apprises them from afar lead them to the proximity of the exact spot and then leaf the final discovery to the airy uncertainty of random searching it is very much like the way in which we ourselves are informed by hearing and smell guide which are far from accurate when we want to decide the precise point of origin of the sound or the smell what are the organ of information that direct the rutting moth on his nightly pilgrimage one suspect the antennæ which in the male do in fact seem to be questioning space with their spreading tuft of feather are those glorious plume mere ornament or do they at the same time play a part in the perception of the effluvium that guide the enamoured swain a conclusive experiment seems to present no difficulty let u try it on the day after the invasion i find in the study eight of my visitor of the day before they are perched motionless on the transom of the second window which is kept closed the others when their dance wa over about ten oclock in the evening went out a they came in that is to say through the first window which is left open day and night those eight persevering one are just what i want for my scheme with a sharp pair of scissors without otherwise touching the moth i cut off their antennæ near the base the patient take hardly any notice of the operation not one move there is scarcely a flutter of the wing these are excellent condition the wound doe not seem at all serious undistraught by pain the moth bereft of their horn will adapt themselves all the better to my plan the rest of the day is spent in placid immobility on the crossbar of the window there are still a few arrangement to be made it is important in particular to shift the scene of operation and not to leave the female before the eye of the maimed one at the moment when they resume their nocturnal flight else the merit of their quest would disappear i therefore move the belljar with it captive and place it under a porch at the other end of the house some fifty yard from my study when night come i go to make a last inspection of my eight victim six have flown out through the open window two remain behind but these have dropped to the floor and no longer have the strength to turn over if i lay them on their back they are exhausted dying pray do not blame my surgical work this quick decreptitude occurs invariably even without the intervention of my scissors six in better condition have gone off will they return to the bait that attracted them yesterday though deprived of their antennæ will they be able to find the cage now put in another place at a considerable distance from it original position the cage is standing in the dark almost in the open air from time to time i go out with a lantern and a butterflynet each visitor is captured examined catalogued and forthwith let loose in an adjoining room of which i close the door this gradual elimination will enable me to tell the exact number with no risk of counting the same moth more than once moreover the temporary gaol which is spacious and bare will in no way endanger the prisoner who will find a quiet retreat there and plenty of room i shall take similar precaution during my subsequent investigation at half past ten no more arrive the sitting is over in all twentyfive male have been caught of whom only one wa without antennæ therefore of the six on whom i operated yesterday and who were hale enough to leave my study and go back to the field one alone ha returned to the belljar it is a poor result on which i dare not rely when it come to asserting or denying that the antennæ play a guiding part we must begin all over again on a larger scale next morning i pay a visit to the prisoner of the day before what i see is not encouraging many are spread out on the floor almost lifeless several of them give hardly a sign of life when i take them in my finger what can i hope from these cripple still let u try perhaps they will recover their vigour when the time come to dance the lover round the twentyfour new one undergo amputation of the antennæ the old hornless one is left out of count a dying or close to it lastly the prisondoor is left open for the remainder of the day he who will may leave the room he who can shall join in the evening festival in order to put such a go out to the test of searching for the bride the cage which they would be sure to notice on the threshold is once more removed i shift it to a room in the opposite wing on the groundfloor the access to this room is of course left free of the twentyfour deprived of their antennæ only sixteen go outside eight remain powerless to move they will soon die where they are out of the sixteen who have left how many are there that return to the cage in the evening not one i sit up to capture just seven all newcomer all sporting feather this result would seem to show that the amputation of the antennæ is a rather serious matter let u not draw conclusion yet a doubt remains and an important one a nice state im in said mouflard the bullpup when his pitiless breeder had docked his ear how dare i show my face before the other dog can it be that my moth entertain master mouflards apprehension once deprived of their fine plume dare they no longer appear amidst their rival and awooing go is it bashfulness on their part or lack of guidance or might it not rather be exhaustion after a wait that exceeds the duration of an ephemeral flame experiment shall tell u on the fourth evening i take fourteen moth all new one and imprison them a they arrive in a room where i intend them to pas the night next morning taking advantage of their daytime immobility i remove a little of the fur from the centre of their corselet the silky fleece come off so easily that this slight tonsure doe not inconvenience the insect at all it deprives them of no organ which may be necessary to them later when the time come to find the cage it mean nothing to the shorn one to me it mean the unmistakable sign that the caller have repeated their visit this time there are no weakling incapable of flight at night the fourteen shaven moth escape into the open of course the place of the cage is once more changed in two hour i capture twenty moth including two tonsured one no more of those who lost their antennæ two day ago not one put in an appearance their nuptial time is over for good and all only two return out of the fourteen marked with a bald patch why do the twelve others hang back although supplied with what we have assumed to be their guide their antennary plume why again that formidable list of defaulter which we find nearly always after a night of sequestration i perceive but one reply the great peacock is quickly worn out by the ardour of pairingtime with a view to his wedding the one and only object of his life the moth is gifted with a wonderful prerogative he is able to discover the object of his desire in spite of distance obstacle and darkness for two or three evening he is allowed a few hour wherein to indulge his search and his amorous exploit if he can not avail himself of them all is over the most exact of compass fails the brightest of lamp expires what is the use of living after that stoically we withdraw into a corner and sleep our last sleep which is the end of our illusion and of our woe alike the great peacock becomes a moth only in order to perpetuate his specie he know nothing of eating while so many others jolly companion one and all flit from flower to flower unrolling the spiral of their proboscis and dipping it into the honeyed cup he the incomparable faster wholly freed from the bondage of the belly ha no thought of refreshment his mouthpart are mere rudiment vain simulacrum not real organ capable of performing their function not a sup enters his stomach a glorious privilege save that it involves a brief existence the lamp need it drop of oil if it is not to be extinguished the great peacock renounces that drop but at the same time he renounces long life two or three evening just time enough to allow the couple to meet and that is all the big moth ha lived then what is the meaning of the staying away of those who have lost their antennæ doe it show that the absence of these organ ha made them incapable of finding the wire bell in which the prisoner awaits them not at all like the shorn one whose operation ha left them uninjured they prove only that their time is up whether maimed or intact they are unfit for duty because of their age and their nonreturn is valueless a evidence for lack of the time necessary for experimenting the part played by the antennæ escape u doubtful it wa and doubtful it remains my caged prisoner life for eight day every evening she draw for my benefit a swarm of visitor in varying number now to one part of the house now to another a i please i catch them a they come with the net and transfer them the moment they are captured to a closed room in which they spend the night next morning i mark them with a tonsure on the thorax the aggregate of the visitor during those eight evening amount to a hundred and fifty an astounding number when i consider how hard i had to seek during the following two year to collect the material necessary for continuing these observation though not impossible to find in my near neighbourhood the cocoon of the great peacock are at least very rare for old almondtrees on which the caterpillar live are scarce in these part for two winter i visited every one of those decayed tree at the lower part of the trunk under the tangle of hard grass in which they are clad and time after time i returned emptyhanded therefore my hundred and fifty moth came from afar from very far within a radius of perhaps a mile and a half or more how did they know of what wa happening in my study the perceptive faculty can receive information from a distance by mean of three agent light sound and smell is it permissible to speak of vision in this instance i will readily admit that sight guide the visitor once they have passed through the open window but before that in the mystery out of door it would not be enough to grant them the fabulous eye of the lynx which wa supposed to see through wall we should have to admit a keenness of sight which could be exercised mile away it is useless to discus anything so outrageous let u pas on sound is likewise out of the question the great fat moth capable of sending a summons to such a distance is mute even to the most acute hearing it is just possible that she posse delicate vibration passionate quiver which might perhaps be perceptible with the aid of an extremely sensitive microphone but remember that the visitor have to be informed at considerable distance thousand of yard away under these condition we can not waste time thinking of acoustic that would be to set silence the task of waking the surrounding air there remains the sense of smell in the domain of our sens scent better than anything else would more or le explain the onrush of the moth even though they do not find the bait that allure them until after a certain amount of hesitation are there in point of fact effluvium similar to what we call odour effluvium of extreme subtlety absolutely imperceptible to ourselves and yet capable of impressing a sense of smell betterendowed than ours there is a very simple experiment to be made it is a question of masking those effluvium of stifling them under a powerful and persistent odour which master the olfactory sense entirely the toostrong scent will neutralize the very faint one i begin by sprinkling naphthaline in the room where the male will be received this evening also in the belljar beside the female i lay a big capsule full of the same stuff when the visitinghour come i have only to stand in the doorway of the room to get a distinct smell of gasworks my artifice fails the moth arrive a usual they enter the room pas through it tarry atmosphere and make for the cage with a much certainty of direction a though in unscented surroundings my confidence in the olfactory explanation is shaken besides i am now unable to go on worn out by her sterile wait my prisoner dy on the ninth day after laying her unfertilized egg on the wirework of the cage in the absence of a subject of experiment there is no more to be done until next year this time i shall take my precaution i shall lay in a stock so a to be able to repeat a often a i wish the experiment which i have already tried and those which i am contemplating to work then and that without delay in the summer i proclaim myself a buyer of caterpillar at a sou apiece the offer appeal to some urchin in the neighbourhood my usual purveyor on thursday emancipated from the horror of parsing 31 they scour the field find the fat caterpillar from time to time and bring him to me clinging to the end of a stick they dare not touch him poor mite they are staggered at my audacity when i take him in my finger a they might take the familiar silkworm reared on almondtree branch my menagerie in a few day supply me with magnificent cocoon in the winter assiduous search at the foot of the fostering tree complete my collection friend interested in my enquiry come to my assistance in short by dint of trouble much running about commercial bargain and not a few scratch from bramble i am the possessor of an assortment of cocoon of which twelve bulkier and heavier than the others tell me that they belong to female a disappointment awaits me for may arrives a fickle month which brings to naught my preparation the cause of so much anxiety we have winter back again the mistral howl tear the budding leaf from the planetrees and strews the ground with them it is a cold a in december we have to light the fire again at night and resume the thick clothes which we were beginning to leave off my moth are sorely tried they hatch late and are torpid around my wire cage in which the female wait one today another tomorrow according to the order of their birth few male or none come from the outside and yet there are some close at hand for the plumed gallant resulting from my harvest were placed out in the garden a soon a they were hatched and recognized whether near neighbour or stranger from afar very few arrive and these are only halfhearted they enter for a moment then disappear and do not return the lover have grown cold it is also possible that the low temperature is unfavourable to the telltale effluvium which might well be enhanced by the warmth and decreased by the cold a happens with scent my year is lost oh what laborious work is this experimenting at the mercy of the sudden change and deception of a short season i begin all over again for the third time i rear caterpillar i scour the country in search of cocoon when may return i am suitably provided the weather is fine and responds to my hope i once more see the incursion which had struck me so powerfully at the beginning at the time of the historic invasion which first led to my research nightly the visitor turn up in squad of twelve twenty or more the female a lusty bigbellied matron cling firmly to the trelliswork of the cage she make no movement give not so much a a flutter of the wing seems indifferent to what is going on nor is there any odour so far a the most sensitive nostril in the household can judge nor any rustle perceptible to the most delicate hearing among my family all of whom are called in to bear evidence in motionless contemplation she wait the others in two or three or more flop down upon the dome of the cage run about it briskly in every direction lash it with the tip of their wing in continual movement there are no affray between rival with not a sign of jealousy in regard to the other suitor each doe his utmost to enter the enclosure tiring of their vain attempt they fly away and join the whirling throng of dancer some giving up all hope escape through the open window fresh arrival take their place and on the top of the cage until ten oclock in the evening attempt to approach are incessantly renewed soon to be abandoned and a soon resumed every evening the cage is moved to a different place i put it on the north side and the south on the groundfloor and the first floor in the right wing and fifty yard away in the left in the open air or hidden in a distant room all these sudden displacement contrived if possible to put the seeker off the scent do not trouble the moth in the least i waste my time and ingenuity in trying to deceive them recollection of place play no part here yesterday for instance the female wa installed in a certain room the feathered male came fluttering thither for a couple of hour several even spent the night there next day at sunset when i move the cage all are out of door ephemeral though they be the newest comer are ready to repeat their nocturnal expedition a second time and a third where will they go first these veteran of a day they know all about the meetingplace of yesterday one is inclined to think that they will go back to it guided by memory and that finding nothing left they will proceed elsewhither to continue their investigation but no contrary to my expectation they do nothing of the sort not one reappears in the place which wa so thickly crowded last night not one pay even a short visit the room is recognized a deserted without the preliminary enquiry which recollection would seem to demand a more positive guide than memory summons them elsewhere until now the female ha been left exposed under the mesh of a wire gauze the visitor whose eye are used to piercing the blackest gloom can see her by the vague light of what to u is darkness what will happen if i imprison her under an opaque cover according to it nature will not this cover either set free or arrest the telltale effluvium physical science is today preparing to give u wireless telegraphy by mean of the hertzian wave can the great peacock have anticipated our effort in this direction in order to set the surrounding air in motion and to inform pretender mile away can the newlyhatched bride have at her disposal electric or magnetic wave which one sort of screen would arrest and another let through in a word doe she in her own manner employ a kind of wireless telegraphy i see nothing impossible in this insect are accustomed to invent thing quite a wonderful i therefore lodge the female in box of various character some are made of tin some of cardboard some of wood all are hermetically closed are even sealed with stout putty i also use a glass belljar standing on the insulating support of a pane of glass well under these condition of strict closing never a male arrives not one however favourable the mildness and quiet of the evening no matter it nature whether of metal or glass of wood or cardboard the closed receptacle form an insuperable obstacle to the effluvium that betray the captive whereabouts a layer of cotton two finger thick give the same result i place the female in a large jar tying a sheet of wadding over the mouth by way of a lid this is enough to keep the neighbourhood in ignorance of the secret of my laboratory no male put in an appearance on the other hand make use of illclosed cracked box or even hide them in a drawer in a cupboard and notwithstanding this added mystery the moth will arrive in number a great a when they come thronging to the trellised cage standing in full view on a table i have retained a vivid recollection of an evening when the recluse wa waiting in a hatbox at the bottom of a closed wallcupboard the moth arrived went to the door struck it with their wing knocked at it to express their wish to enter passing wayfarer coming no one know whence across the field they well knew what wa inside there behind those board we must therefore reject the idea of any mean of information similar to that of wireless telegraphy for the first screen set up whether a good conductor or a bad stop the female signal completely to give these a free passage and carry them to a distance one condition is indispensable the receptacle in which the female is contained must be imperfectly closed so a to establish a communication between the inner and the outer air this brings u back to the probability of an odour though that wa contradicted by my experiment with naphthaline my stock of cocoon is exhausted and the problem is still obscure shall i try again another year the fourth i abandon the thought for the fallowing reason moth that mate at night are difficult to observe if i want to watch their intimate action the gallant certainly need no illuminant to attain his end but my feeble human power of vision can not dispense with one at night i must have at least a candle which is often extinguished by the whirling swarm a lantern save u from these sudden eclipse but it dim light streaked with broad shadow doe not suit a conscientious observer like myself who want to see and to see clearly nor is this all the light of a lamp diverts the moth from their object distracts them from their business and if persistent gravely compromise the success of the evening the visitor no sooner enter the room than they make a wild rush for the flame singe their fluff in it and thenceforth frightened by the scorching received cease to be trustworthy witness when they are not burnt when they are kept at a distance by a glass chimney they perch a close a they can to the light and there stay hypnotized one evening the female wa in the diningroom on a table facing the open window a lighted paraffinlamp with a large whiteenamel shade wa hanging from the ceiling two of the arrival alighted on the dome of the cage and fussed around the prisoner seven others after greeting her a they passed made for the lamp circled about it a little and then fascinated by the radiant glory of the opal cone perched on it motionless under the shade already the childrens hand were raised to seize them dont i said leave them alone let u be hospitable and not disturb these pilgrim to the tabernacle of light all that evening not one of the seven budged next morning they were still there the intoxication of light had made them forget the intoxication of love with creature so madly enamoured of the radiant flame precise and prolonged experiment becomes unfeasible the moment the observer requires an artificial illuminant i give up the great peacock and his nocturnal nuptials i want a moth with different habit equally skilled in keeping conjugal appointment but performing in the daytime before continuing with a subject that fulfils these condition let u drop chronological order for a moment and say a few word about a latecomer who arrived after i had completed my enquiry i mean the lesser peacock attacus pavonia minor lin somebody brought me i dont know where from a magnificent cocoon loosely wrapped in an ample whitesilk envelope out of this covering with it thick irregular fold it wa easy to extract a case similar in shape to the great peacock but a good deal smaller the foreend worked into the fashion of an eeltrap by mean of free and converging fibre which prevent access to the dwelling while permitting egress without a breach of the wall indicated a kinswoman of the big nocturnal moth the silk bore the spinner mark and in point of fact towards the end of march on the morning of palm sunday the cocoon with the eeltrap formation provides me with a female of the lesser peacock whom i at once seclude under a wiregauze bell in my study i open the window to allow the event to be made known all over the district i want the visitor if any come to find free entrance the captive grip the wire and doe not move for a week a gorgeous creature is my prisoner in her brown velvet streaked with wavy line she ha white fur around her neck a speck of carmine at the tip of the upper wing and four large eyeshaped spot in which black white red and yellowochre are grouped in concentric crescent the dress is very like that of the great peacock but le dark in colouring i have seen this moth so remarkable for size and costume three or four time in my life it wa only the other day that i first saw the cocoon the male i have never seen i only know that according to the book he is half the size of the female and of a brighter and more florid colour with orangeyellow on the lower wing will he come the unknown spark the plumewearer on whom i have never set eye so rare doe he appear to be in my part of the country in his distant hedge will he receive news of the bride that awaits him on my study table i venture to feel sure of it and i am right here he come even sooner than i expected on the stroke of noon a we were sitting down to table little paul who is late owing to his eager interest in what is likely to happen suddenly run up to u his cheek aglow in his finger flutter a pretty moth a moth caught that moment hovering in front of my study paul show me his prize his eye ask an unspoken question hullo i say this is the very pilgrim we were expecting let fold up our napkin and go and see whats happening we can dine later dinner is forgotten in the presence of the wonder that are taking place with inconceivable punctuality the plumewearers hasten to answer the captive magic call they arrive one by one with a tortuous flight all of them come from the north this detail ha it significance a a matter of fact during the past week we have experienced a fierce return of winter the north wind ha been blowing a gale killing the imprudent almondblossoms it wa one of those ferocious storm which a a rule usher in the spring in our part of the world today the temperature ha suddenly grown milder but the wind is still blowing from the north now at this first visit all the moth hurrying to the prisoner enter the enclosure from the north they follow the movement of the air not one beat against it if their compass were a sense of smell similar to our own if they were guided by odoriferous particle dissolved in the air they ought to arrive from the opposite direction if they came from the south we might believe them to be informed by effluvium carried by the wind coming a they do from the north through the mistral that mighty sweeper of the atmosphere how can we suppose them to have perceived at a great distance what we call a smell this reflux of scented atom in a direction contrary to the aerial current seems to me inadmissible for a couple of hour in radiant sunshine the visitor come and go outside the front of the study most of them search for a long while exploring the wall flitting along the ground to see their hesitation one would think that they were at a loss to discover the exact place of the bait that attracts them though they have come from very far without mistake they seem uncertain of their bearing once they are on the spot nevertheless sooner or later they enter the room and pay their respect to the captive without much importunity at two oclock all is over ten moth have been here all through the week each time at noonday when the light is at it brightest moth arrive but in decreasing number the total is nearly forty i see no reason to repeat experiment which could add nothing to what i already know and i confine myself to stating two fact in the first place the lesser peacock is a day insect that is to say he celebrates his wedding in the brilliant light of the middle of the day he need radiant sunshine the great peacock on the contrary whom he so closely resembles in his adult form and in the work which he doe a a caterpillar requires the dusk of the early hour of the night let him who can explain this strange contrast of habit in the second place a powerful aircurrent sweeping the other way any particle capable of instructing the sense of smell doe not prevent the moth arriving from a direction opposite to that of the odoriferous flux a our physic imagine it if i am to go on with my observation i want a day moth not the lesser peacock who made his appearance too late at a time when i had nothing to ask him but another no matter whom provided that he be quick at discovering nuptial feast shall i find this moth the banded monk yes i shall find him indeed i have him already a little chap of seven with a wideawake face that doesnt get washed every day bare foot and a pair of tattered breech held up by a bit of string a boy who come regularly to supply the house with turnip and tomato arrives one morning carrying his basket of vegetable after the few sou due to his mother for the green have been counted one by one into his hand he produce from his pocket something which he found the day before beside a hedge while picking grass for the rabbit and what about this he asks holding the thing out to me what about this will you have it yes certainly ill have it try and find me some more a many a you can and ill promise you plenty of ride on the roundabout on sunday meanwhile my lad here a penny for you dont make a mistake when you give in your account put it somewhere where you wont mix it up with the turnipmoney dazzled with delight at the sight of so much wealth my little ragamuffin promise to search with a will already seeing vision of a fortune to be his when he ha gone i examine the thing it is worth while it is a handsome cocoon bluntshaped not at all unlike the product of our silkworm nursery of a firm consistency and a tawny colour the cursory information which i have picked up from book of reference make me almost certain that it is the bombyx of the oak the oak eggar if this is so what luck i shall be able to continue my observation and perhaps complete what the great peacock began to show me the oak eggar is in fact a classic there is not an entomological treatise but speaks of his exploit in the weddingseason they tell u how a mother hatch in captivity inside a room and even hidden in a box she is far away from the country amid the tumult of a big town the event is nevertheless divulged to those whom it concern in the wood and the meadow guided by some inconceivable compass the male arrive hastening from the distant field they go to the box tap at it fly round and round it i had read of these marvel but seeing seeing with one own eye and at the same time experimenting a little is quite another matter what doe my penny purchase hold in store for me will the famous bombyx emerge from it let u call her by her other name the banded monk this unusual name of monk is suggested by the male dress a monk frock of a modest rusty brown but in this case the stuff is a delicious velvet with a pale transversal band and a little white eyeshaped dot on the front wing the banded monk is not in my region a common moth whom we are likely to catch if the fancy take u to go out with a net at the proper season i have never seen it about the village especially not in my lonely enclosure during all the twenty year that i have spent here i am not a fervent hunter i admit the collector dead insect interest me very little i want it alive in the full exercise of it faculty but i make up for the absence of the collector zeal by an attentive eye for all that enlivens the field a moth so remarkable in size and costume would certainly not have escaped me had i met him the little seeker whom i had caught so nicely with a promise of the roundabout never made a second find for three year i requisitioned friend and neighbour especially the youngster those sharpeyed scraper of the brushwood i myself scraped a great deal under mass of dead leaf inspected stoneheaps examined hollow treetrunks my trouble wa in vain the precious cocoon wa nowhere to be found suffice it to say that the banded monk is very scarce in my neighbourhood the importance of this detail will be seen when the time come a i suspected my solitary cocoon did belong to the famous moth on the 20th of august there emerges a female corpulent and bigbellied attired like the male but in a lighter frock more in the nankeen style i establish her in a wiregauze belljar in the middle of my study on the big laboratorytable littered with book pot tray box testtubes and other engine of science i have described the setting before it is the same a in the case of the great peacock the room is lighted by two window looking out on the garden one is closed the other is kept open day and night the moth is placed between the two in the shadow some four or five yard away the rest of the day and the following day pas without anything worth mentioning hanging by her claw to the front of the trelliswork on the side nearest the light the prisoner is motionless inert there is no waving of the wing no quivering of the antennæ even so did the female great peacock behave the mother bombyx matures her tender flesh hardens by some process of which our science ha not the remotest idea she elaborates an irresistible bait which will bring caller flocking to her from the four corner of the heaven what take place in that fat body what transformation are performed that shall presently revolutionize everything around were they known to u the moth nostrum would add a cubit to our stature on the third day the bride is ready the festivity burst into full swing i wa in the garden already despairing of success so long were thing delayed when at about three oclock in the afternoon in very hot weather and brilliant sunshine i saw a host of moth gyrating in the embrasure of the open window it is the lover coming to call upon their sweetheart some are just leaving the room others going in others again are perched upon the wall resting a though jaded after a long journey i see some approaching in the distance over the wall over the curtain of cypresstrees they are hurrying up from all direction but becoming more and more rare i missed the beginning of the reception and the guest are nearly all here let u go upstairs this time in broad daylight without losing a single detail i once more witness the bewildering spectacle into which the great night moth initiated me my study is filled with a swarm of male whom i estimate at a glance to number about sixty a far a it is possible to make a count in this seething mass after circling a few time round the cage several go to the open window but return again forthwith and resume their evolution the most eager perch on the cage hustle and trample on one another fighting for the good place inside the barrier the captive wait impassively with her great paunch hanging against the wire she give not a sign of emotion in the presence of the turbulent throng going in or going out fussing round the cage or flitting through the room for more than three hour they keep up their frenzied saraband but the sun is sinking the temperature becomes a little cooler chilled likewise is the ardour of the moth many go out and do not come in again others take up their position in readiness for the morrow they settle on the transom of the closed window a the great peacock did the celebration is over for today it will certainly be renewed tomorrow for it is still without result because of the wire but ala to my great dismay it is not renewed and this through my own fault late in the day some one brings me a praying mantis worthy of attention because of her exceptionally small size preoccupied with the event of the afternoon without thinking what i am doing i hastily place the carnivorous insect in the cage that hold my bombyx not for a moment do i dream that this cohabitation can turn out ill the mantis is such a little slender thing the other is so obese and thus i entertained no apprehension ah little did i know the bloodthirsty fury of which the grapnelled insect is capable next morning to my bitter astonishment i find the tiny mantis devouring the huge moth the head and the front part of the breast have already disappeared horrible creature what a disappointment i owe to you farewell to my research which i had cherished in my imagination all night long not for three year shall i be able to resume them for lack of a subject bad luck must not however make u forget the little that we have learnt at one sitting some sixty male came considering the rarity of the monk and remembering the year of fruitless search conducted by my assistant and myself we stand astounded at this number with a female for a bait the undiscoverable ha suddenly become a multitude now where did they come from from every quarter and from very far beyond a doubt during my year of exploration of my neighbourhood i have got to know every bush in it and every heap of stone and i am in a position to declare that there are no oak eggar there to make the swarm that filled my study the whole of the surrounding district must have contributed from this side and from that within a radius which i dare not determine three year pas and fortune persistently entreated at last grant me two monkcocoons towards the middle of august both of them within a few day of each other give me a female this is a piece of luck which will allow me to vary and renew my test i quickly repeat the experiment which have already procured me a most positive reply from the great peacock the pilgrim of the day is no le clever than the pilgrim of the night he baffle all my trick he hastens infallibly to the prisoner in her wiregauze cage in whatever part of the house the apparatus be installed he is able to discover her hidden in a cupboard he guess her secret presence in a box of any kind provided that it be not tightly closed he cease to come for lack of information when the casket is hermetically sealed thus far we see merely a repetition of the feat of the great peacock a wellclosed box the air contained in which doe not communicate with the outer atmosphere leaf the monk in complete ignorance of the prisoner whereabouts not one arrives even when the box is exposed for every eye to see in the window this brings back more urgently than ever the idea of odoriferous effluvium intransmissible through a wall of metal cardboard wood or glass no matter which when put to the test the great night moth wa not baffled by the naphthaline whose powerful smell ought to my thinking to mask ultrasubtle emanation imperceptible to any human nostril i repeat the experiment with the monk this time i lavish all the resource in the way of scent and stench that my store of drug permit i place the saucer partly inside the wiregauze cage the female prison and partly all round it in a continuous circle some contain naphthaline others oil of lavender others paraffin others lastly alkaline sulphur smelling of rotten egg short of asphyxiating the prisoner i can do no more these arrangement are made in the morning so that the room may be thoroughly saturated when the trystinghour arrives in the afternoon the study ha become an odious laboratory in which the penetrating aroma of lavenderoil and the foul stench of sulphuretted hydrogen predominate remember that i smoke in this room and plentifully at that will the concentrated odour of a gasworks a smoker divan a scentshop an oilwell and a chemical factory succeed in putting off the monk not at all a little before three the moth arrive a numerous a ever they go to the cage which i have taken pain to cover with a thick kitchencloth so a to increase the difficulty though they see nothing after they have entered though they are steeped in a foreign atmosphere in which any subtle fragrance should have been annihilated they fly towards the prisoner and try to get at her by slipping under the fold of the cloth my artifice are fruitless after this reverse so definite in it result which repeat what my naphthaline experiment with the great peacock taught me i ought logically speaking to give up the theory that odorous effluvium serve a a guide to the moth invited to the nuptial feast that i did not do so wa due to a casual observation the unexpected the fortuitous often provides u with one of those surprise which show u the road to the truth hitherto sought in vain one afternoon trying to discover whether sight play any part in the search once that the moth have entered the room i place the female in a glass belljar and give her a little oakbranch with withered leaf a a perch the apparatus is put on a table opposite the open window on entering the moth can not fail to see the prisoner standing a she doe where they are bound to pas the pan with it layer of sand in which the female spent the previous night and the morning under a wiregauze cover is in my way i put it without premeditation on the floor at the other end of the room in a corner which is only dimly lighted it is seven yard from the window the result of these preparation upset all my idea of the moth arriving none stop at the glass bell where the female is plainly visible in the full light they pas by with utter indifference not a glance in her direction not an enquiry they all fly right to the far end of the room to the dusky corner where i placed the tray and the cage they alight on the trellised top and explore it at length flapping their wing and hustling one another a little all the afternoon until sunset they dance around the deserted dome the same saraband to which the actual presence of the female would give rise at last they fly away but not all of them there are persistent one who refuse to go rooted to the spot by some magic attraction a strange result indeed my moth hasten to where there is nothing take their stand there and will not be dissuaded by the repeated warning of their eye they pas without stopping for a moment by the bellglass in which the female can not fail to be perceived by one or other of those coming and going befooled by a lure they pay no attention to the real thing what is it that deceives them the whole of the night before and all this morning the female ha sojourned under the wiregauze cover either hanging to the trelliswork or resting on the sand in the pan whatever she touched above all with her fat belly apparently ha become impregnated a the result of long contact with certain emanation there you have her bait her lovephiltre there you have what revolutionizes the world of monk the sand retains it for a time and spread it effluvium around it is smell therefore that guide the moth that give them information at a distance dominated by the sense of smell they take no notice of what their eye tell them they pas by the glass prison in which their ladylove is now interned they go to the wire to the sand on which the magic cruet have shed their content they race to the wilderness where naught remains of the witch but the scented evidence of her sojourn the irresistible philtre take a certain time to elaborate i picture it a an exhalation which is gradually given off and saturates everything that touch the fat motionless creature when the glass bell stand directly on the table or better still on a square of glass the communication between the interior and the outer air is insufficient and the male perceiving nothing by the sense of smell keep away however long the experiment be continued at the actual moment i can not substantiate this nontransmission through a screen for even if i establish ample communication if i separate the bell from it support by mean of three wedge the moth do not come at first however many there may be in the room but wait for half an hour more or le the alembic of feminine flavour begin it distilling and the rush of visitor take place a usual now that i posse these data this unexpected light on the subject i am at liberty to vary my experiment all of which lead to the same conclusion in the morning i establish the female under a wiregauze cover her perch is a little oaktwig similar to the last here motionless a though dead she remains for long hour buried in the tuft of leaf that is to be impregnated with her emanation when visitingtime approach i withdraw the twig perfectly saturated and lay it on a chair near the open window on the other hand i leave the female under her cover well in view on the table in the middle of the room the moth arrive first one then two and three soon five and six they come in go out come in again fly up and down go to and fro keeping all the time to the neighbourhood of the chair with it oakbranch not one make for the big table a few pace farther into the room where the female is waiting for them under the trellised dome they are hesitating that is clear they are seeking at last they find and what do they find the very twig which in the morning had served the potbellied matron a a bed with wing swiftly fluttering they alight upon the branch they explore it above and below probe it lift it and move it until at last the little bit of foliage drop on the floor the probing between the leaf continues none the le under the buffeting of the wing and the clawing of the foot the stick is now running along the ground like a scrap of paper pawed by a kitten while the twig is moving away with it band of explorer two new arrival come upon the scene on their way they have to pas the chair which for a brief spell bore the leafy stick they stop at it and eagerly investigate the very spot which but now wa covered by the branch and yet in their case a in that of the others the real object of their desire is close by them under a wire gauze which i have omitted to veil no one notice it on the floor the monk continue to hustle the mattress on which the female lay in the morning on the chair they still fumble at the spot where this bedding wa first placed the sun go down the time come to depart besides the effluvium of passion are growing fainter are dispersing the visitor go away without more ado goodbye till tomorrow the following test tell me that any material no matter what can take the place of the leafy branch that chance inspiration of mine some time in advance i place the female on a couch of cloth or flannel of wadding or paper i even subject her to the hardship of a campbed of wood glass marble or metal all these object after a contact of sufficient length have the same powerful attraction for the male a the mother monk herself they retain this property to a varying extent according to their nature the best are wadding flannel dust sand in short porous object metal marble and glass on the contrary soon lose their efficacy lastly anything on which the female ha rested communicates it virtue to other place by simple contact a witness the moth crowding to the seat of the canebottomed chair after the oakbranch had fallen from it let u use one of the best bed flannel for instance and we shall see a curious thing i place at the bottom of a long testtube or of a narrownecked bottle just wide enough to allow of the moth passage a piece of flannel on which the mother ha been lying all the morning the caller go into the vessel flounder about do not know how to get out again i have invented a mousetrap for them by mean of which i could do terrific execution let u release the poor thing remove the piece of stuff and put it away in an hermetically closed box the infatuated moth go back to the testtube headlong reenter the trap they are attracted by the effluvium which the saturated flannel ha imparted to the glass i am fully convinced to summon the moth of the district to the wedding to apprise them at a distance of her presence and to guide them the bride emits an extremely subtle scent imperceptible to our own organ of smell with the mother monk held to their nostril those around me perceive not the least odour not even the youngest whose sens are not yet vitiated this quintessence easily impregnates every object on which the female rest for any length of time and thenceforth the actual object becomes a potent a centre of attraction a the mother herself until the emanation are dispelled nothing visible betrays the bait on a piece of paper a recent restingplace around which the visitor crowd there is not an appreciable trace no moisture of any kind the surface is just a clean a before the impregnation the product is slowly elaborated and ha to accumulate a little while before manifesting it full strength when taken from her couch and placed elsewhere the female loses her attraction for the time and becomes an object of indifference it is the restingplace saturated by long contact that draw the newcomer but the battery are recharged and the deserted one recovers her power the appearance of the warning effluvium is delayed for a longer or shorter period according to the specie the newlyhatched moth ha to mature for a time and to put her distillery in order a female great peacock born in the morning sometimes ha visitor that same evening but oftener on the second day after preparation lasting some forty hour the female banded monk adjourns her summons longer than that her banns of marriage are not published until after two or three day waiting let u return for a moment to the problematical function of the antennæ the male monk sport a sumptuous pair similar to those of the great peacock who vies with him in his matrimonial expedition are we to look upon these hairy feeler a a guiding compass i repeat without laying much stress on the matter my former amputation none of the patient come back we must be chary of drawing inference however the great peacock ha shown u that the failure to return is due to more serious reason than amputation of the horn moreover a second monk the clover bombyx nearly akin to the first and like him superbly plumed set u an exceedingly perplexing problem he is fairly plentiful around my place even in the enclosure i find his cocoon which might easily be confused with that of the oak bombyx i am deceived at first by the resemblance out of six cocoon from which i expected to obtain banded monk six female of the other specie hatch at the end of august well around those six female born in my house never a male appears though there is no doubt that the tufted one are present in the neighbourhood if spreading feathered antennæ are really organ for receiving information at a distance why are not my richlyhorned neighbour informed of what is happening in my study why do their fine plume leave them indifferent to event that would bring the banded monk hastening up in crowd once more the organ doe not determine the aptitude this one is gifted and that one is not despite organic similarity the sense of smell in physic we hear of nothing nowadays but the röntgen ray which penetrate dense body and photograph the invisible for u a fine discovery but how insignificant in face of the surprise which the future reserve for u when betterinformed of the why and wherefore of thing we supplement with art the feebleness of our sens and succeed in rivalling be it ever so little the keenness of perception revealed by the brute creation how enviable in many case is this animal superiority it teach u the poverty of our attainment it declares the mediocrity of our sensory apparatus it give u evidence of impression foreign to our nature it proclaims reality so far in excess of our attribute that they astound u a wretched caterpillar the pine processionary split his back into meteorological airholes which snuff the coming weather and foretell the squall the bird of prey with it incomparably long sight see from high in the cloud the fieldmouse squatting on the ground the blinded bat guide their flight without injury to themselves amid spallanzani 32 inextricable maze of thread the carrierpigeon though moved a hundred league from home infallibly regains his cote across immensity which he ha never traversed unaided within the limit of her humbler flight a bee the chalicodoma 33 also span the unknown accomplishes a long journey and return to her mass of cell the man who ha never seen a dog hunting for truffle doe not know one of the finest achievement of the sense of smell absorbed in it function the animal trot along with it nose to the wind at a moderate pace it stop question the ground with it nostril scratch for a few second without undue excitement and look up at it master here we are it seems to say here we are on my word of honour a a dog there a truffle here and it speaks the truth the master dig at the point indicated if the trowel go astray the dog show the man how to put it right by sniffing at the bottom of the hole do not be afraid of the stone and root in between despite the depth and intervening obstacle the tuber will come a dog nose can not lie subtlety of smell you say i have no objection if by that you mean that the animal nasal passage are the organ of perception but is the thing perceived always a mere smell in the ordinary acceptation of the word an effluvium such a our own sens understand it i have some reason to doubt this let u set the matter forth i have had the good fortune on several occasion to accompany a dog who wa a great expert at his trade certainly he wa nothing to look at this artist whom i wa so anxious to see at work just a dog placid and deliberate in his way ugly unkempt the sort of dog that you would never admit to your fireside talent and poverty often go hand in hand his master a celebrated rabassier 34 in the village convinced that i had no intention of stealing his secret and one day setting up in competition allowed me to join him in his expedition a favour which he did not often grant the worthy man wa quite willing to fall in with my view once he saw that i wa not an apprentice but merely an enquirer who made drawing 35 and wrote down list of underground vegetable thing instead of marketing my bagful of treasuretrove the glory of the christmas turkey it wa agreed between u that the dog should act a he pleased and receive a bit of bread a his reward after each discovery indiscriminately every spot scratched up by his paw wa to be dug and the object indicated extracted without our troubling about it commercial value in no case wa the master experience to intervene and divert the dog from a spot where practice told him that nothing saleable wa to be found for in drawing up my botanical list i preferred wretched and unmarketable product to the choicest morsel though these of course were welcomed when they appeared thus conducted the underground botanizing wa very fruitful with his perspicacious nose the dog made me gather indifferently the large and the small the fresh and the putrid the scented and the unscented the fragrant and the stinking i wa amazed at my collection which comprised the greater part of the hypogean fungi in my neighbourhood what a variety of structure and above all of odour the primary quality in this question of scent there are some that have nothing more noticeable than a vague fungous mustiness which is more or le evident in all some smell of turnip of rotten cabbage some are fetid enough to fill the collector house with their stench the real truffle alone posse the aroma dear to the epicure if smell a we understand it is the dog only guide how doe he manage to find his way through all these incongruous odour is he apprised of the content of the soil by a general emanation the fungous effluvium common to the different specie in that case an extremely embarrassing question arises i paid some attention to the ordinary mushroom many of which a yet invisible announced their coming a imminent by cracking the surface of the ground now i never saw the dog stop at any of those point where my eye divined the cryptogam pushing back the earth with the thrust of it cap point where the ordinary fungous smell wa certainly most pronounced he passed them by scornfully with not a sniff with not a stroke of his paw and yet the thing wa underground and it reek wa similar to others which he sometimes pointed out to u i came back from the dog school with the conviction that the truffledetecting nose ha a better guide than smell in the sense in which our olfactory power realize it it must perceive in addition effluvium of a different order full of mystery to u who are not equipped accordingly light ha it dark ray which are without effect upon our retinæ but not apparently upon all why should not the domain of smell have it secret emanation unknown to our sens but perceptible to a differently constructed organ of smell if the scent of the dog leaf u perplexed to this extent that it is impossible for u to say exactly or even to suspect what it perceives it at least tell u plainly that we should be greatly mistaken to compare everything by human standard the world of sensation is far larger than the limit of our sensibility admit what a number of fact in the working of the force of nature escape u for want of organ delicate enough to perceive them the unknown that inexhaustible field which the future will cultivate hold harvest in store for u beside which our present knowledge is but a pitiful gleaning under the sickle of science sheaf will one day fall whose grain today would seem a senseless paradox scientific illusion not so if you please but undeniable and positive reality affirmed by the animal world which in certain respect ha a great advantage over the world of man in spite of his long professional practice in spite of the aroma of the tuber which he is seeking the rabassier can not guess the presence of the truffle which ripens in winter underground at a depth of eighteen inch or so he need the aid of the dog or the pig whose scent pry into the secret of the soil well these secret are known to different insect even better than to our two helper in order to discover the tuber on which their family of grub is to be fed they posse a scent of exceptional perfection long ago from truffle dug up spoilt and teeming with vermin and placed in this condition in a glass jar with a layer of fresh sand i obtained first a small red beetle anisotoma cinnamomea panz and then various diptera including a sapromyzon who with her sluggish flight and feeble frame reminds me of a fly clad in yellow velvet known a scatophaga scybalaria that placid frequenter of human excrement in autumn the latter find her truffle on the surface of the ground at the foot of a wall or hedge man usual hasty refuge in the country but how doe the other know at what point underground lie hers or rather her grub truffle to go down and hunt about in the depth is beyond her power her frail limb which the moving of a grain of sand would warp her wing which if extended would block her way through a gorge her dress of stiff silk militating against a smooth passage these are all against her the sapromyzon is obliged to lay her egg on the surface of the soil but she must do so at the very spot beneath which the truffle lie for the tiny grub would die if they had to roam at random until they came upon their provender which is always sparsely distributed the trufflehunting fly is therefore informed by her sense of smell of the spot favourable to her maternal plan she posse the scent of the rabassier dog indeed probably a better one for she know thing by nature having never been taught whereas her rival ha only received an artificial education it would be interesting to follow the sapromyzons manœuvres but the idea strike me a impracticable the insect is rare fly away quickly and is soon out of sight to observe it closely to watch it at work would involve a great loss of time and a degree of assiduity of which i do not feel capable another discoverer of underground fungi shall reveal what the fly could hardly be expected to show u this is a pretty little black beetle with a pale and velvety belly round a a cherrystone and much the same size the insect official title is bolboceras gallicus muls by rubbing the tip of it abdomen against the edge of it wingcases it emits a soft chirrup similar to that of the little bird when their mother come home with their food the male wear a graceful horn on his head copied on a smaller scale from that of the spanish copris 36 deceived by this armour i at first took the insect for a member of the dungbeetles corporation and brought it up a such in captivity i served it with these stercoral dainty which are most appreciated by it presumed colleague but never no never did it consent to touch them fie for shame dung to a bolboceras well what on earth did i take him for the epicure expects something very different he want not exactly the truffle of our banquet but it equivalent this characteristic wa not displayed to me without patient investigation on my part at the southern foot of the sérignan hill not far from the village stand a thicket of maritime pine alternating with row of cypresstrees here at the season of all saint after the autumnal rain the mushroom abound that frequent the coniferæ in particular the delicious milkmushroom which turn green at any part that is bruised and shed tear of blood when you break it 37 in the mild day of autumn this is the favourite walk of my household being far enough to exercise young leg and near enough not to tire them they find everything there old magpie nest formed of bundle of twig jay squabbling with one another after filling their crop with acorn on the oak hard by rabbit suddenly starting out of a rosemarybush showing their little white upturned scut geotrupes 38 hoarding away food for the winter and heaping up their rubbish on the threshold of the burrow and then lovely sand soft to the touch easy to dig into tunnel easy to build into row of hut which we thatch with moss and surmount with a bit of reed by way of a chimney and the delicious lunch off an apple to the sound of the æolian harp softly sighing through the pineneedles yes for the child it is a real paradise where one go a a reward for welllearnt lesson the grownup also have their share of enjoyment a far a i am concerned i have for many year been watching two insect here without succeeding in discovering their family secret one of them is minotaurus typhœus 39 whose male carry on his corselet three spike pointing in front of him the old writer used to call him the phalangist because of his armour which may be compared with the three line of spear of the macedonian phalanx he is a robust fellow who care nothing for the winter all through the cold season whenever the weather turn a trifle milder he leaf his house discreetly at nightfall and gather in the immediate neighbourhood of his burrow a few sheepdroppings ancient oliveshaped remains dried by the summer sun he heap them in a stack at the bottom of his larder shuts the door and eats when the provision are all crumbed and drained of their niggardly juice he climb back to the surface and renews his store thus doe he spend the winter never resting from his work except when the weather is too severe the second object of my observation in the pinewood is the bolboceras his burrow distributed here and there among those of the minotaur are easily distinguished the phalangist are surmounted by a bulky mound the material of which are heaped into a cylinder a long a one finger each of these roll is a load of rubbish pushed outside by the digger thrusting with his back from below the orifice moreover is closed whenever the beetle is at home either enlarging the shaft or peacefully enjoying his possession the bolboceras lodging is open and surrounded merely by a padding of sand it depth is slight nine inch hardly more it go straight down in very loose soil it is easily inspected therefore if we take care first to dig a trench in front of it which will enable u later to cut away the perpendicular wall slice by slice with the blade of a knife the burrow then appears at full length from top to bottom in a semicylindrical shape often the violated dwellinghouse is empty the insect ha left during the night having finished it business there and gone to settle elsewhere the bolboceras is a nomad a nightwalker who leaf his home without regret and easily acquires a new one sometimes also the insect is found at the bottom of the pit at one time a male at another a female but never the two at a time the sex both equally zealous in digging burrow work separately not together this is not in fact a family residence containing the nursery of the young it is a temporary abode dug by each occupant for his own comfort sometimes we find nothing there but the wellsinker surprised during his work of excavation sometimes lastlyand the case is not uncommonthe hermit of the crypt embrace with his leg a small hypogean fungus either intact or partly consumed he clutch it convulsively refuse to be parted from it it is his booty his fortune his worldly good scattered crumb tell u that we have caught him feasting let u take his prize away from him we shall see a sort of irregular rugged purse closed on every side and varying in size between a pea and a cherry outside it is reddish rough with little wart inside it is smooth and white the spore which are ovoid and diaphanous are contained in row of eight in long satchel by these characteristic we recognize an underground cryptogamous product nearly related to the truffle and known to botanist a hydnocystis arenaria tul this throw a light upon the habit of the bolboceras and upon the reason why his burrow are so frequently renewed in the calm of the twilight the little gadabout take to the field chirruping softly a he go cheering himself with song he explores the soil question it a to it content just a the dog doe when hunting for truffle his sense of smell warns him when the coveted morsel is underneath covered by a few inch of sand certain of the exact spot where the thing lie he dig straight down and never fails to reach it a long a the provision last he doe not go out again blissfully he feed at the bottom of the well heedless of the door left open or hardly barred when no more food remains he move looking for another loaf which will become the excuse for a fresh burrow to be abandoned in it turn each fungus consumed represents a new house which is a mere refectory a traveller refreshmentroom thus are the autumn and spring the season of the hydnocystis spent in the pleasure of the table from one home to the next to study the rabassier insect more closely in my own house i should need a little store of it favourite fare it would be waste of time to seek for it myself by digging at random the little cryptogam is not so plentiful that i can hope to strike it with my trowel without a guide the trufflehunter need his dog my informer shall be the bolboceras himself behold me turned into a rabassier of a new kind i reveal my secret which can only raise a smile from my original instructor in underground botany if he should ever hear of my singular form of competition the subterranean fungi occur only at certain point often in group now the beetle ha been this way with his delicate scent he ha recognized the site a good for the burrow are numerous hereabouts we will therefore dig near the hole the clue is accurate in a few hour thanks to the track left by the bolboceras i posse a handful of hydnocystes it is the first time that i have gathered this particular fungus let u now catch the insect that present no difficulty we have only to dig up the burrow i make my experiment the same evening filling a large earthen pan with fresh sifted sand with a stick a thick a my finger i make six vertical tunnel in the sand two decimetre 40 deep and placed at a suitable distance apart a hydnocystis is lowered to the bottom of each and i insert a fine straw to show me the exact position later lastly i fill up the six cavity with caked sand when this surface ha been carefully smoothed so that the level is everywhere the same except for the six straw landmark that mean nothing to the bolboceras i let loose my captive covering them with a wiregauze cage there are eight of them at first there is nothing to see save the inevitable uneasiness due to the incident of their exhumation transport and confinement in an unknown place my exile from home try to escape climb up the wire burrow right at the edge of the enclosure night fall and thing grow calmer two hour later i come to take a last look at them three are still buried under a thin layer of sand the five others have each dug a perpendicular shaft at the very foot of the straw which tell me where the fungi lie next morning the sixth straw ha it well like the others this is the moment to see what is happening underground i remove the sand methodically in vertical slice at the bottom of each burrow is a bolboceras eating his truffle the hydnocystis let u repeat the experiment with the partlyconsumed victual the result is the same at one brief nocturnal spell of work the dainty is discovered underground and reached by mean of a gallery which run plumb to the spot where the morsel lie there is no hesitation no trial excavation guided by guesswork this is proved by the surface of the soil which everywhere is just a i left it when i smoothed it down the insect could not have made straighter for the coveted object had it been guided by sight it always dig at the foot of the straw my signpost the dog nosing the ground for truffle hardly achieves this degree of precision ha the hydnocystis then a very pungent smell able to give such positive information to it consumer scent not at all to our nostril it is a neutral object devoid of any appreciable olfactory character a tiny pebble taken out of the ground would impress u just a much with it faint aroma of fresh earth a a revealer of underground fungous product the bolboceras here rival the dog he would even rise superior to the dog were he able to generalize but he is a rigorous specialist he know only the hydnocystis nothing else so far a i am aware tempts him to dig 41 both of them search the subsoil very closely at the level of the ground and the object which they seek is not far down were they farther away neither the dog nor the insect would notice effluvium so subtle not even the smell of a truffle to make an impression at a great distance powerful odour are needed capable of perception by our olfactory sense then the exploiter of the odorous thing come hastening up on all side from afar when for the purpose of my study i require insect that dissect corps i expose a dead mole in the sun in a distant corner of the enclosure a soon a the animal swell distended by the gas of putrefaction and the skin begin to turn green and the fur to fall from it up come number of silphæ 42 and dermestes 43 necrophori 44 and other buryingbeetles of whom one would find not a single specimen in the garden or even in the neighbourhood without this bait they have been informed by their sense of smell at a great distance all around whereas i myself can avoid the stench by taking a few step back compared with their scent mine is contemptible but still in their case a well a mine there is really here what our language call a smell i can do better still with the flower of the dragon arum arum dracunculus so remarkable for it shape and for it unequalled stench imagine a wide lanceolate blade of a clarety purple half a yard long and rolled below into an ovoid pouch the size of a hen egg through the opening of this wallet rise a central column springing from the bottom a long brightgreen club encircled at it base by two bracelet one of ovary the other of stamen such briefly described is the flower or rather the inflorescence of the dragon arum for two day it exhales a frightful stench of carrion worse than the proximity of a dead dog would yield during the hottest part of the day with a wind blowing it is loathsome unbearable let u brave the infected atmosphere and go up to it we shall behold a curious sight informed by the foul odour which spread far and wide various insect come flying along such insect a make sausagemeat of small corpsestoads adder lizard hedgehog mole fieldmicewhich the husbandman hit with his spade and fling away disembowelled on the footpath they swoop down upon the great leaf which with it livid purple look like a strip of meat gone bad they caper about intoxicated by the smell of corpse which they love they roll down the slope and are swallowed up in the purse after a few hour of bright sunshine the receptacle is full let u look inside through the narrow opening no elsewhere could you see such a crowd it is a mad whirl of back and belly of wingcases and leg swarming rolling over and over amid the snap of interlocked joint rising and falling floating and sinking seething and bubbling without end it is a drunken revel an epidemic of delirium tremens some few a yet emerging from the mass climb to the opening by mean of the central pole or the wall of the enclosure will they take wing and make their escape not they standing on the brink of the chasm almost free they drop back into the whirlpool in a fresh bout of intoxication the bait is irresistible not one of them will quit the assembly until the evening or perhaps next morning when the heady fume have evaporated then the mass becomes disentangled and the insect extricate themselves from one anothers embrace and slowly a it were regretfully leave the place and fly away at the bottom of this devil purse remains a heap of dead and dying of severed limb and disjointed wingcases the inevitable result of the frenzied orgy soon woodlouse earwig and ant will arrive and devour the deceased what were they doing there were they the prisoner of the flower had it converted itself into a trap which allowed them to enter but prevented them from escaping by mean of a fence of converging hair no they were not prisoner they had full liberty to go away a is shown by the final exodus which is effected without impediment deceived by a false odour were they doing their best to instal their egg a they would have done under a corpse not that either there is no trace of an attempt at egglaying in the dragon purse they came enticed by the smell of a dead body their supreme delight they were drunk with corpse and they spun round frantically in an undertaker carnival when the bacchanal dance is at it height i try to count the number of the arrival i rip up the floral pouch and pour it content into a flask absolutely tipsy though they be many would escape during the census which i wish to take accurately a few drop of carbon bisulphide deprive the crowd of motion the counting then show that there were over four hundred such wa the living billow which i saw surging just now in the dragon purse the throng consists entirely of two family dermestes and saprini 45 both of whom are very busy in spring turning derelict corps to account here is a complete list of the visitor to a single flower with the number of representative of each specie dermestes frischii kugel 120 d undulatus brahm 90 d pardalis schoenh 1 saprinus subnitidus de mar 160 s maculatus ross 4 s detersus illig 15 s semipunctatus de mar 12 s œneus fabr 2 s speculifer latr 2 total 406 another detail deserves attention just a much a this enormous figure and that is the complete absence of a number of other genus which are a passionately fond of small corps a are the dermestes and saprini my charnelhouses of mole never fail to be visited by the silphæ and necrophori silpha sinuata fabr s rugosa lin s obscura lin necrophorus vestigator hersch the reek of the dragon arum leaf them all indifferent none of them is represented in the ten flower which i examine nor are any diptera those other devotee of corruption several fly some grey or bluey others a metallic green come up it is true settle on the edge of the flower and even find their way into the fetid wallet but they are almost immediately undeceived and fly away only the dermestes and saprini stay behind why my friend bull a decent a dog a ever lived had this among many other eccentricity if he found in the dust of the road the dried up corpse of a mole flattened under the heel of the passersby mummified by the heat of the sun he would revel in rolling himself over it from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail he would rub himself in it over and over again shaken with nervous spasm turning first on one side then on the other it wa his sachet of musk his flask of eaudecologne when scented to his liking he would get up shake himself and trot off pleased a punch with his pomade let u not abuse him and above all let u not discus the matter there are taste of all kind in this world why should not some of the insect that dote on the smell of the dead have similar habit dermestes and saprini come to the dragon arum all day long they swarm in throng although free to go away many of them die in the riot of the orgy it is no rich provender that keep them for the flower give them nothing to eat it is not a question of laying egg for they take good care not to settle their grub in that faminestricken spot what are they doing here the frenzied one apparently intoxicating themselves with fetidness just a bull did on the carcass of a mole and this intoxication of smell attracts them from every part around from very far perhaps one can not tell even so the necrophori in quest of an establishment for their young hasten from the field to my putrefying mole both are informed by a potent smell which offends our nostril sixty yard away but which travel ahead and delight them at distance where our own power of scent cease the hydnocystis the bolboceras treat ha none of these violent emanation capable of being diffused through space it is devoid of smell at least to u the insect that hunt for it doe not come from a distance it inhabits the very place where the cryptogam lie however faint the effluvium of the underground morsel the prying epicure equipped for the purpose ha every facility for perceiving them he operates close by on the surface of the soil the dog case is the same he go along searching with his nose to the ground then too the real truffle the essential object of his quest posse a most pronounced odour but what are we to say of the great peacock and the banded monk making their way to the female born in captivity they hasten from the end of the horizon what do they perceive at that distance is it really an odour a our physiology understands the word i can not bring myself to believe it the dog smell the truffle by sniffing the earth quite close to the tuber he find his master at great distance by consulting the scent of his footprint but is he able to discover the truffle hundred of yard away mile away can he join his master in the complete absence of a trail certainly not for all his fineness of scent the dog is incapable of such a feat which is performed however by the moth who is put off neither by distance nor by the lack of any trace out of door of the female hatched on my table it is a recognized fact that smell ordinary smell the smell that affect our nostril consists of molecule emanating from the scented body the odorous matter dissolve and is diffused throughout the air by communicating to the air it aroma even a sugar dissolve and is diffused in water by communicating to the water it sweetness smell and taste touch each other at some point in both case there is a contact between the material particle that give the impression and the sensitive papillæ that receive it nothing can be simpler or clearer than that the dragon arum elaborates an intensely strong essence with which the air is impregnated and infected all around thus the dermestes and saprini those passionate lover of carrion smell are informed by molecular diffusion in the same way the putrid toad give out and disseminates the stinking atom that are the necrophorus delight but what is materially emitted by the female bombyx or great peacock nothing according to our sense of smell and this nothing is supposed when the male congregate to saturate an immense circle several mile in radius with it molecule what the horrible stench of the dragon arum is unable to do the absence of odour is believed to accomplish however divisible matter may be the mind refuse to accept such conclusion it would be tantamount to reddening a lake with an atom of carmine to filling immensity with nothing another argument when my study is saturated beforehand with pungent odour which ought to overcome and destroy the most delicate effluvium the male moth arrive without the least sign of embarrassment a loud noise kill the faint note and prevents it from being heard a bright light eclipse a feeble gleam these are wave of the same nature but the roar of thunder can not cause the least jet of light to pale nor can the dazzling glory of the sun stifle the least sound being of different nature light and sound do not influence each other the experiment with the lavenderoil naphthaline and the rest would therefore seem to prove that odour proceeds from two source for emission substitute undulation and the problem of the great peacock is explained without losing any of it substance a luminous point shake the ether with it vibration and fill a circle of indefinite width with light this must almost express the working of the mother bombyx telltale discharge it doe not emit molecule it vibrates it set in motion wave capable of spreading to distance incompatible with a real diffusion of matter in it entirety smell would thus seem to have two domain that of the particle dissolved in the air and that of the ethereal wave the first alone is known to u it belongs also to the insect it is this which informs the saprinus of the dragon arum fetidity and the silpha and necrophorus of the stench of the mole the second which is far superior in it range through space escape u altogether because we lack the necessary sensory equipment the great peacock and the banded monk know it at the time of the nuptial rejoicing and many others must share it in various degree according to the exigency of their mode of life like light odour ha it xrays should science one day instructed by the insect endow u with a radiograph of smell this artificial nose will open out to u a world of marvel the cabbagecaterpillar the cabbage of our modern kitchengardens is a semiartificial plant the produce of our agricultural ingenuity quite a much a of the niggardly gift of nature spontaneous vegetation supplied u with the longstalked scantyleaved illsmelling wilding a found according to the botanist on the ocean cliff he had need of a rare inspiration who first showed faith in this rustic clown and proposed to improve it in his gardenpatch progressing by infinitesimal degree culture wrought miracle it began by persuading the wild cabbage to discard it wretched leaf beaten by the seawinds and to replace them by others ample and fleshy and closefitting the gentle cabbage submitted without protest it deprived itself of the joy of light by arranging it leaf in a large compact head white and tender in our day among the successor of those first tiny heart are some that by virtue of their massive bulk have earned the glorious name of chou quintal a who should say a hundredweight of cabbage they are real monument of green stuff later man thought of obtaining a generous dish with the thousand little spray of the inflorescence the cabbage consented under the cover of the central leaf it gorged with food it sheaf of blossom it flowerstalks it branch and worked the lot into a fleshy conglomeration this is the cauliflower the broccoli differently entreated the plant economizing in the centre of it shoot set a whole family of closewrapped cabbage ladderwise on a tall stem a multitude of dwarf leafbuds took the place of the colossal head this is the brussels sprout next come the turn of the stump an unprofitable almost wooden thing which seemed never to have any other purpose than to act a a support for the plant but the trick of gardener are capable of everything so much so that the stalk yield to the grower suggestion and becomes fleshy and swell into an ellipse similar to the turnip of which it posse all the merit of corpulence flavour and delicacy only the strange product serf a a base for a few sparse leaf the last protest of a real stem that refuse to lose it attribute entirely this is the colerape if the stem allows itself to be allured why not the root it doe in fact yield to the blandishment of agriculture it dilates it pivot into a flat turnip which half emerges from the ground this is the rutabaga or swede the turnipcabbage of our northern district incomparably docile under our nursing the cabbage ha given it all for our nourishment and that of our cattle it leaf it flower it bud it stalk it root all that it now want is to combine the ornamental with the useful to smarten itself to adorn our flowerbed and cut a good figure on a drawingroom table it ha done this to perfection not with it flower which in their modesty continue intractible but with it curly and variegated leaf which have the undulating grace of ostrichfeathers and the rich colouring of a mixed bouquet none who beholds it in this magnificence will recognize the near relation of the vulgar green that form the basis of our cabbagesoup the cabbage first in order of date in our kitchengardens wa held in high esteem by classic antiquity next after the bean and later the pea but it go much farther back so far indeed that no memory of it acquisition remain history pay but little attention to these detail it celebrates the battlefield whereon we meet our death it scorn to speak of the ploughed field whereby we thrive it know the name of the king bastard it can not tell u the origin of wheat that is the way of human folly this silence respecting the precious plant that serve a food is most regrettable the cabbage in particular the venerable cabbage that denizen of the most ancient gardenplots would have had extremely interesting thing to teach u it is a treasure in itself but a treasure twice exploited first by man and next by the caterpillar of the pieris the common large white butterfly whom we all know pieris brassicæ lin this caterpillar feed indiscriminately on the leaf of all variety of cabbage however dissimilar in appearance he nibble with the same appetite red cabbage and broccoli curly green and savoy swede and turniptops in short all that our ingenuity lavish of time and patience ha been able to obtain from the original plant since the most distant age but what did the caterpillar eat before our cabbage supplied him with copious provender obviously the pieris did not wait for the advent of man and his horticultural work in order to take part in the joy of life she lived without u and would have continued to live without u a butterfly existence is not subject to ours but rightfully independent of our aid before the whiteheart the cauliflower the savoy and the others were invented the pieris caterpillar certainly did not lack food he browsed the wild cabbage of the cliff the parent of all the latterday wealth but a this plant is not widely distributed and is in any case limited to certain maritime region the welfare of the butterfly whether on plain or hill demanded a more luxuriant and more common plant for pasturage this plant wa apparently one of the cruciferæ more or le seasoned with sulphuretted essence like the cabbage let u experiment on these line i rear the pieris caterpillar from the egg upwards on the wallrocket diplotaxis tenuifolia dec which imbibes strong spice along the edge of the path and at the foot of the wall penned in a large wiregauze bellcage they accept this provender without demur they nibble it with the same appetite a if it were cabbage and they end by producing chrysalids and butterfly the change of fare cause not the least trouble i am equally successful with other crucifer of a le marked flavour white mustard sinapis incana lin dyer woad isatis tinctoria lin wild radish raphanus raphanistrum lin whitlow pepperwort lepidium draba lin hedgemustard sisymbrium officinale scop on the other hand the leaf of the lettuce the bean the pea the cornsalad are obstinately refused let u be content with what we have seen the fare ha been sufficiently varied to show u that the cabbagecaterpillar feed exclusively on a large number of crucifer perhaps even on all a these experiment are made in the enclosure of a bellcage one might imagine that captivity impels the flock to feed in the absence of better thing on what it would refuse were it free to hunt for itself having naught else within their reach the starveling consume any and all cruciferæ without distinction of specie can thing sometimes be the same in the open field where i play none of my trick can the family of the white butterfly be settled on other crucifer than the cabbage i start a quest along the path near the garden and end by finding on wild radish and white mustard colony a crowded and prosperous a those established on cabbage now except when the metamorphosis is at hand the caterpillar of the white butterfly never travel he doe all his growing on the identical plant whereon he saw the light the caterpillar observed on the wild radish a well a other household are not therefore emigrant who have come a a matter of fancy from some cabbagepatch in the neighbourhood they have hatched on the very leaf where i find them hence i arrive at this conclusion the white butterfly who is fitful in her flight chooses cabbage first to dab her egg upon and different cruciferæ next varying greatly in appearance how doe the pieris manage to know her way about her botanical domain we have seen the larini 46 those explorer of fleshy receptacle with an artichoke flavour astonish u with their knowledge of the flora of the thistle tribe but their lore might at a pinch be explained by the method followed at the moment of housing the egg with their rostrum they prepare niche and dig out basin in the receptacle exploited and consequently they taste the thing a little before entrusting their egg to it on the other hand the butterfly a nectardrinker make not the least enquiry into the savoury quality of the leafage at most dipping her proboscis into the flower she abstract a mouthful of syrup this mean of investigation moreover would be of no use to her for the plant selected for the establishing of her family is for the most part not yet in flower the mother flit for a moment around the plant and that swift examination is enough the emission of egg take place if the provender be found suitable the botanist to recognize a crucifer requires the indication provided by the flower here the pieris surpasses u she doe not consult the seedvessel to see if it be long or short nor yet the petal four in number and arranged in a cross because the plant a a rule is not in flower and still she recognizes offhand what suit her caterpillar in spite of profound difference that would embarrass any but a botanical expert unless the pieris ha an innate power of discrimination to guide her it is impossible to understand the great extent of her vegetable realm she need for her family cruciferæ nothing but cruciferæ and she know this group of plant to perfection i have been an enthusiastic botanist for half a century and more nevertheless to discover if this or that plant new to me is or is not one of the cruciferæ in the absence of flower and fruit i should have more faith in the butterfly statement than in all the learned record of the book where science is apt to make mistake instinct is infallible the pieris ha two family a year one in april and may the other in september the cabbagepatches are renewed in those same month the butterfly calendar tally with the gardener the moment that provision are in sight consumer are forthcoming for the feast the egg are a bright orangeyellow and do not lack prettiness when examined under the lens they are blunted cone ranged side by side on their round base and adorned with finelyscored longitudinal ridge they are collected in slab sometimes on the upper surface when the leaf that serf a a support is spread wide sometimes on the lower surface when the leaf is pressed to the next one their number varies considerably slab of a couple of hundred are pretty frequent isolated egg or egg collected in small group are on the contrary rare the mother output is affected by the degree of quietness at the moment of laying the outer circumference of the group is irregularly formed but the inside present a certain order the egg are here arranged in straight row backing against one another in such a way that each egg find a double support in the preceding row this alternation without being of an irreproachable precision give a fairly stable equilibrium to the whole to see the mother at her laying is no easy matter when examined too closely the pieris decamps at once the structure of the work however reveals the order of the operation pretty clearly the ovipositor swing slowly first in this direction then in that by turn and a new egg is lodged in each space between two adjoining egg in the previous row the extent of the oscillation determines the length of the row which is longer or shorter according to the layer fancy the hatching take place in about a week it is almost simultaneous for the whole mass a soon a one caterpillar come out of it egg the others come out also a though the natal impulse were communicated from one to the other in the same way in the nest of the praying mantis a warning seems to be spread abroad arousing every one of the population it is a wave propagated in all direction from the point first struck the egg doe not open by mean of a dehiscence similar to that of the vegetablepods whose seed have attained maturity it is the newborn grub itself that contrives an exitway by gnawing a hole in it enclosure in this manner it obtains near the top of the cone a symmetrical dormerwindow cleanedged with no join nor unevenness of any kind showing that this part of the wall ha been nibbled away and swallowed but for this breach which is just wide enough for the deliverance the egg remains intact standing firmly on it base it is now that the lens is best able to take in it elegant structure what it see is a bag made of ultrafine goldbeatersskin translucent stiff and white retaining the complete form of the original egg a score of streaked and knotted line run from the top to the base it is the wizard pointed cap the mitre with the groove carved into jewelled chaplet all said the cabbagecaterpillars birthcasket is an exquisite work of art the hatching of the lot is finished in a couple of hour and the swarming family muster on the layer of swaddlingclothes still in the same position for a long time before descending to the fostering leaf it lingers on this kind of hotbed is even very busy there busy with what it is browsing a strange kind of grass the handsome mitre that remain standing on end slowly and methodically from top to base the newborn grub nibble the wallet whence they have just emerged by tomorrow nothing is left of these but a pattern of round dot the base of the vanished sack a his first mouthful therefore the cabbagecaterpillar eats the membranous wrapper of his egg this is a regulation diet for i have never seen one of the little grub allow itself to be tempted by the adjacent green stuff before finishing the ritual repast whereat skin bottle furnish forth the feast it is the first time that i have seen a larva make a meal of the sack in which it wa born of what use can this singular fare be to the budding caterpillar i suspect a follows the leaf of the cabbage are waxed and slippery surface and nearly always slant considerably to graze on them without risking a fall which would be fatal in earliest childhood is hardly possible unless with mooring that afford a steady support what is needed is bit of silk stretched along the road a fast a progress is made something for the leg to grip something to provide a good anchorage even when the grub is upside down the silktubes where those mooring are manufactured must be very scantily supplied in a tiny newborn animal and it is expedient that they be filled without delay with the aid of a special form of nourishment then what shall the nature of the first food be vegetable matter slow to elaborate and niggardly in it yield doe not fulfil the desired condition at all well for time press and we must trust ourselves safely to the slippery leaf an animal diet would be preferable it is easier to digest and undergoes chemical change in a shorter time the wrapper of the egg is of a horny nature a silk itself is it will not take long to transform the one into the other the grub therefore tackle the remains of it egg and turn it into silk to carry with it on it first journey if my surmise is wellfounded there is reason to believe that with a view to speedily filling the silkglands to which they look to supply them with rope other caterpillar beginning their existence on smooth and steeplyslanting leaf also take a their first mouthful the membranous sack which is all that remains of the egg the whole of the platform of birthsacks which wa the first campingground of the white butterfly family is razed to the ground naught remains but the round mark of the individual piece that composed it the structure of pile ha disappeared the print left by the pile remain the little caterpillar are now on the level of the leaf which shall henceforth feed them they are a pale orangeyellow with a sprinkling of white bristle the head is a shiny black and remarkably powerful it already give sign of the coming gluttony the little animal measure scarcely two millimetre 47 in length the troop begin it steadyingwork a soon a it come into contact with it pasturage the green cabbageleaf here there in it immediate neighbourhood each grub emits from it spinningglands short cable so slender that it take an attentive lens to catch a glimpse of them this is enough to ensure the equilibrium of the almost imponderable atom the vegetarian meal now begin the grub length promptly increase from two millimetre to four soon a moult take place which alters it costume it skin becomes speckled on a paleyellow ground with a number of black dot intermingled with white bristle three or four day of rest are necessary after the fatigue of breaking cover when this is over the hungerfit start that will make a ruin of the cabbage within a few week what an appetite what a stomach working continuously day and night it is a devouring laboratory through which the foodstuff merely pas transformed at once i serve up to my caged herd a bunch of leaf picked from among the biggest two hour later nothing remains but the thick midrib and even these are attacked when there is any delay in renewing the victual at this rate a hundredweightcabbage doled out leaf by leaf would not last my menagerie a week the gluttonous animal therefore when it swarm and multiplies is a scourge how are we to protect our garden against it in the day of pliny the great latin naturalist a stake wa set up in the middle of the cabbagebed to be preserved and on this stake wa fixed a horse skull bleached in the sun a mare skull wa considered even better this sort of bogey wa supposed to ward off the devouring brood my confidence in this preservative is but an indifferent one my reason for mentioning it is that it reminds me of a custom still observed in our own day at least in my part of the country nothing is so longlived a absurdity tradition ha retained in a simplified form the ancient defensive apparatus of which pliny speaks for the horse skull our people have substituted an eggshell on the top of a switch stuck among the cabbage it is easier to arrange also it is quite a useful that is to say it ha no effect whatever everything even the nonsensical is capable of explanation with a little credulity when i question the peasant our neighbour they tell me that the effect of the eggshell is a simple a can be the butterfly attracted by the whiteness come and lay their egg on it broiled by the sun and lacking all nourishment on that thankless support the little caterpillar die and that make so many fewer i insist i ask them if they have ever seen slab of egg or mass of young caterpillar on those white shell never they reply with one voice well then it wa done in the old day and so we go on doing it thats all we know and thats enough for u i leave it at that persuaded that the memory of the horse skull used once upon a time is ineradicable like all the rustic absurdity implanted by the age we have when all is said but one mean of protection which is to watch and inspect the cabbageleaves assiduously and crush the slab of egg between our finger and thumb and the caterpillar with our foot nothing is so effective a this method which make great demand on one time and vigilance what pain to obtain an unspoilt cabbage and what a debt do we not owe to those humble scraper of the soil those ragged hero who provide u with the wherewithal to live to eat and digest to accumulate reserve whence the butterfly will issue that is the caterpillar one and only business the cabbagecaterpillar performs it with insatiable gluttony incessantly it browse incessantly digest the supreme felicity of an animal which is little more than an intestine there is never a distraction unless it be certain seesaw movement which are particularly curious when several caterpillar are grazing side by side abreast then at interval all the head in the row are briskly lifted and a briskly lowered time after time with an automatic precision worthy of a prussian drillground can it be their method of intimidating an always possible aggressor can it be a manifestation of gaiety when the wanton sun warms their full paunch whether sign of fear or sign of bliss this is the only exercise that the glutton allow themselves until the proper degree of plumpness is attained after a month grazing the voracious appetite of my caged herd is assuaged the caterpillar climb the trelliswork in every direction walk about anyhow with their forepart raised and searching space here and there a they pas the swaying herd put forth a thread they wander restlessly anxiously to travel afar the exodus now prevented by the trellised enclosure i once saw under excellent condition at the advent of the cold weather i had placed a few cabbagestalks covered with caterpillar in a small greenhouse those who saw the common kitchen vegetable sumptuously lodged under glass in the company of the pelargonium and the chinese primrose were astonished at my curious fancy i let them smile i had my plan i wanted to find out how the family of the large white butterfly behaves when the cold weather set in thing happened just a i wished at the end of november the caterpillar having grown to the desired extent left the cabbage one by one and began to roam about the wall none of them fixed himself there or made preparation for the transformation i suspected that they wanted the choice of a spot in the open air exposed to all the rigour of winter i therefore left the door of the hothouse open soon the whole crowd had disappeared i found them dispersed all over the neighbouring wall some thirty yard off the thrust of a ledge the eaves formed by a projecting bit of mortar served them a a shelter where the chrysalid moult took place and where the winter wa passed the cabbagecaterpillar posse a robust constitution unsusceptible to torrid heat or icy cold all that he need for his metamorphosis is an airy lodging free from permanent damp the inmate of my fold therefore move about for a few day on the trelliswork anxious to travel afar in search of a wall finding none and realizing that time press they resign themselves each one supporting himself on the trellis first weave around himself a thin carpet of white silk which will form the sustaining layer at the time of the laborious and delicate work of the nymphosis he fix his rearend to this base by a silk pad and his forepart by a strap that pass under his shoulder and is fixed on either side to the carpet thus slung from his three fastening he strip himself of his larval apparel and turn into a chrysalis in the open air with no protection save that of the wall which the caterpillar would certainly have found had i not interfered of a surety he would be shortsighted indeed that pictured a world of good thing prepared exclusively for our advantage the earth the great fostermother ha a generous breast at the very moment when nourishing matter is created even though it be with our own zealous aid she summons to the feast host upon host of consumer who are all the more numerous and enterprising in proportion a the table is more amply spread the cherry of our orchard is excellent eating a maggot contends with u for it possession in vain do we weigh sun and planet our supremacy which fathom the universe can not prevent a wretched worm from levying it toll on the delicious fruit we make ourselves at home in a cabbagebed the son of the pieris make themselves at home there too preferring broccoli to wild radish they profit where we have profited and we have no remedy against their competition save caterpillarraids and eggcrushing a thankless tedious and none too efficacious work every creature ha it claim on life the cabbagecaterpillar eagerly put forth his own so much so that the cultivation of the precious plant would be endangered if others concerned did not take part in it defence these others are the auxiliary 48 our helper from necessity and not from sympathy the word friend and foe auxiliary and ravagers are here the mere convention of a language not always adapted to render the exact truth he is our foe who eats or attack our crop our friend is he who feed upon our foe everything is reduced to a frenzied contest of appetite in the name of the might that is mine of trickery of highway robbery clear out of that you and make room for me give me your seat at the banquet that is the inexorable law in the world of animal and more or le ala in our own world a well now among our entomological auxiliary the smallest in size are the best at their work one of them is charged with watching over the cabbage she is so small she work so discreetly that the gardener doe not know her ha not even heard of her were he to see her by accident flitting around the plant which she protects he would take no notice of her would not suspect the service rendered i propose to set forth the tiny midget desert scientist call her microgaster glomeratus what exactly wa in the mind of the author of the name microgaster which mean little belly did he intend to allude to the insignificance of the abdomen not so however slight the belly may be the insect nevertheless posse one correctly proportioned to the rest of the body so that the classic denomination far from giving u any information might mislead u were we to trust it wholly nomenclature which change from day to day and becomes more and more cacophonous is an unsafe guide instead of asking the animal what it name is let u begin by asking what can you do what is your business well the microgasters business is to exploit the cabbagecaterpillar a clearlydefined business admitting of no possible confusion would we behold her work in the spring let u inspect the neighbourhood of the kitchengarden be our eye never so unobservant we shall notice against the wall or on the withered grass at the foot of the hedge some very small yellow cocoon heaped into mass the size of a hazelnut beside each group lie a cabbagecaterpillar sometimes dying sometimes dead and always presenting a most tattered appearance these cocoon are the work of the microgasters family hatched or on the point of hatching into the perfect stage the caterpillar is the dish whereon that family ha fed during it larval state the epithet glomeratus which accompanies the name of microgaster suggests this conglomeration of cocoon let u collect the cluster a they are without seeking to separate them an operation which would demand both patience and dexterity for the cocoon are closely united by the inextricable tangle of their surfacethreads in may a swarm of pigmy will sally forth ready to get to business in the cabbage colloquial language us the term midge and gnat to describe the tiny insect which we often see dancing in a ray of sunlight there is something of everything in those aerial ballet it is possible that the persecutrix of the cabbagecaterpillar is there along with many another but the name of midge can not properly be applied to her he who say midge say fly dipteron twowinged insect and our friend ha four wing one and all adapted for flying by virtue of this characteristic and others no le important she belongs to the order of hymenoptera 49 no matter a our language posse no more precise term outside the scientific vocabulary let u use the expression midge which pretty well conveys the general idea our midge the microgaster is the size of an average gnat she measure 3 or 4 millimetre 50 the two sex are equally numerous and wear the same costume a black uniform all but the leg which are pale red in spite of this likeness they are easily distinguished the male ha an abdomen which is slightly flattened and moreover curved at the tip the female before the laying ha hers full and perceptibly distended by it ovular content this rapid sketch of the insect should be enough for our purpose if we wish to know the grub and especially to inform ourselves of it manner of living it is advisable to rear in a cage a numerous herd of cabbagecaterpillars whereas a direct search on the cabbage in our garden would give u but a difficult and uncertain harvest by this mean we shall daily have a many a we wish before our eye in the course of june which is the time when the caterpillar quit their pasture and go far afield to settle on some wall or other those in my fold finding nothing better climb to the dome of the cage to make their preparation and to spin a supporting network for the chrysalids need among these spinner we see some weakling working listlessly at their carpet their appearance make u deem them in the grip of a mortal disease i take a few of them and open their belly using a needle by way of a scalpel what come out is a bunch of green entrails soaked in a bright yellow fluid which is really the creature blood these tangled intestine swarm with little lazy grub varying greatly in number from ten or twenty at least to sometimes halfahundred they are the offspring of the microgaster what do they feed on the lens make conscientious enquiry nowhere doe it manage to show me the vermin attacking solid nourishment fatty tissue muscle or other part nowhere do i see them bite gnaw or dissect the following experiment will tell u more fully i pour into a watchglass the crowd extracted from the hospitable paunch i flood them with caterpillar blood obtained by simple prick i place the preparation under a glass belljar in a moist atmosphere to prevent evaporation i repeat the nourishing bath by mean of fresh bleeding and give them the stimulant which they would have gained from the living caterpillar thanks to these precaution my charge have all the appearance of excellent health they drink and thrive but this state of thing can not last long soon ripe for the transformation my grub leave the diningroom of the watchglass a they would have left the caterpillar belly they come to the ground to try and weave their tiny cocoon they fail in the attempt and perish they have missed a suitable support that is to say the silky carpet provided by the dying caterpillar no matter i have seen enough to convince me the larva of the microgaster do not eat in the strict sense of the word they live on soup and that soup is the caterpillar blood examine the parasite closely and you shall see that their diet is bound to be a liquid one they are little white grub neatly segmented with a pointed forepart splashed with tiny black mark a though the atom had been slaking it thirst in a drop of ink it move it hindquarter slowly without shifting it position i place it under the microscope the mouth is a pore devoid of any apparatus for disintegrationwork it ha no fang no horny nipper no mandible it attack is just a kiss it doe not chew it suck it take discreet sip at the moisture all around it the fact that it refrain entirely from biting is confirmed by my autopsy of the stricken caterpillar in the patient belly notwithstanding the number of nurseling who hardly leave room for the nurse entrails everything is in perfect order nowhere do we see a trace of mutilation nor doe aught on the outside betray any havoc within the exploited caterpillar graze and move about peacefully giving no sign of pain it is impossible for me to distinguish them from the unscathed one in respect of appetite and untroubled digestion when the time approach to weave the carpet for the support of the chrysalis an appearance of emaciation at last point to the evil that is at their vitals they spin nevertheless they are stoic who do not forget their duty in the hour of death at last they expire quite softly not of any wound but of anæmia even a a lamp go out when the oil come to an end and it ha to be the living caterpillar capable of feeding itself and forming blood is a necessity for the welfare of the grub it ha to last about a month until the microgasters offspring have achieved their full growth the two calendar synchronize in a remarkable way when the caterpillar leaf off eating and make it preparation for the metamorphosis the parasite are ripe for the exodus the bottle dry up when the drinker cease to need it but until that moment it must remain more or le wellfilled although becoming limper daily it is important therefore that the caterpillar existence be not endangered by wound which even though very tiny would stop the working of the bloodfountains with this intent the drainers of the bottle are in a manner of speaking muzzled they have by way of a mouth a pore that suck without bruising the dying caterpillar continues to lay the silk of his carpet with a slow oscillation of the head the moment now come for the parasite to emerge this happens in june and generally at nightfall a breach is made on the ventral surface or else in the side never on the back one breach only contrived at a point of minor resistance at the junction of two segment for it is bound to be a toilsome business in the absence of a set of filingtools perhaps the worm take one anothers place at the point attacked and come by turn to work at it with a kiss in one short spell the whole tribe issue through this single opening and is soon wriggling about perched on the surface of the caterpillar the lens can not perceive the hole which close on the instant there is not even a hæmorrhage the bottle ha been drained too thoroughly you must press it between your finger to squeeze out a few drop of moisture and thus discover the spot of exit around the caterpillar who is not always quite dead and who sometimes even go on weaving his carpet a moment longer the vermin at once begin to work at their cocoon the strawcoloured thread drawn from the silkglands by a backward jerk of the head is first fixed to the white network of the caterpillar and then produce adjacent warpbeams so that by mutual entanglement the individual work are welded together and form an agglomeration in which each of the worm ha it own cabin for the moment what is woven is not the real cocoon but a general scaffolding which will facilitate the construction of the separate shell all these frame rest upon those adjoining and mixing up their thread become a common edifice wherein each grub contrives a shelter for itself here at last the real cocoon is spun a pretty little piece of closelywoven work in my rearingjars i obtain a many group of those tiny shell a my future experiment can wish for threefourths of the caterpillar have supplied me with them so ruthless ha been the toll of the spring birth i lodge these group one by one in separate glass tube thus forming a collection on which i can draw at will while in view of my experiment i keep under observation the whole swarm produced by one caterpillar the adult microgaster appears a fortnight later in the middle of june there are fifty in the first tube examined the riotous multitude is in the full enjoyment of the pairingseason for the two sex always figure among the guest of any one caterpillar what animation what an orgy of love the carnival of those pigmy bewilders the observer and make his head swim most of the female wishful of liberty plunge down to the waist between the glass of the tube and the plug of cottonwool that close the end turned to the light but the lower half remain free and form a circular gallery in front of which the male hustle one another take one anothers place and hastily operate each bides his turn each attends to his little matter for a few moment and then make way for his rival and go off to start again elsewhere the turbulent wedding last all the morning and begin afresh next day a mighty throng of couple embracing separating and embracing once more there is every reason to believe that in garden the mated one finding themselves in isolated couple would keep quieter here in the tube thing degenerate into a riot because the assembly is too numerous for the narrow space what is lacking to complete it happiness apparently a little food a few sugary mouthful extracted from the flower i serve up some provision in the tube not drop of honey in which the puny creature would get stuck but little strip of paper spread with that dainty they come to them take their stand on them and refresh themselves the fare appears to agree with them with this diet renewed a the strip dry up i can keep them in very good condition until the end of my inquisition there is another arrangement to be made the colonist in my spare tube are restless and quick of flight they will have to be transferred presently to sundry vessel without my risking the loss of a good number or even the whole lot a loss which my hand my forceps and other mean of coercion would be unable to prevent by checking the nimble movement of the tiny prisoner the irresistible attraction of the sunlight come to my aid if i lay one of my tube horizontally on the table turning one end towards the full light of a sunny window the captive at once make for this brighter end and play about there for a long while without seeking to retreat if i turn the tube in the opposite direction the crowd immediately shift it quarter and collect at the other end the brilliant sunlight is it great joy with this bait i can send it whithersoever i please we will therefore place the new receptacle jar or testtube on the table pointing the closed end towards the window at it mouth we open one of the full tube no other precaution is needed even though the mouth leaf a large interval free the swarm hastens into the lighted chamber all that remains to be done is to close the apparatus before moving it the observer is now in control of the multitude without appreciable loss and is able to question it at will we will begin by asking how do you manage to lodge your germ inside the caterpillar this question and others of the same category which ought to take precedence of everything else are generally neglected by the impaler of insect who care more for the nicety of nomenclature than for glorious reality he classifies his subject dividing them into regiment with barbarous label a work which seems to him the highest expression of entomological science name nothing but name the rest hardly count the persecutor of the pieris used to be called microgaster that is to say little belly today she is called apantales that is to say the incomplete what a fine step forward we now know all about it can our friend at least tell u how the little belly or the incomplete get into the caterpillar not a bit of it a book which judging by it recent date should be the faithful echo of our actual knowledge informs u that the microgaster insert her egg direct into the caterpillar body it go on to say that the parasitic vermin inhabit the chrysalis whence they make their way out by perforating the stout horny wrapper hundred of time have i witnessed the exodus of the grub ripe for weaving their cocoon and the exit ha always been made through the skin of the caterpillar and never through the armour of the chrysalis the fact that it mouth is a mere clinging pore deprived of any offensive weapon would even lead me to believe that the grub is incapable of perforating the chrysalids covering this proved error make me doubt the other proposition though logical after all and agreeing with the method followed by a host of parasite no matter my faith in what i read in print is of the slightest i prefer to go straight to fact before making a statement of any kind i want to see what i call seeing it is a slower and more laborious process but it is certainly much safer i will not undertake to lie in wait for what take place on the cabbage in the garden that method is too uncertain and besides doe not lend itself to precise observation a i have in hand the necessary material to wit my collection of tube swarming with the parasite newly hatched into the adult form i will operate on the little table in my animal laboratory a jar with a capacity of about a litre 51 is placed on the table with the bottom turned towards the window in the sun i put into it a cabbageleaf covered with caterpillar sometimes fully developed sometimes halfway sometimes just out of the egg a strip of honeyed paper will serve the microgaster a a diningroom if the experiment is destined to take some time lastly by the method of transfer which i described above i send the inmate of one of my tube into the apparatus once the jar is closed there is nothing left to do but to let thing take their course and to keep an assiduous watch for day and week if need be nothing worth remarking can escape me the caterpillar graze placidly heedless of their terrible attendant if some giddypates in the turbulent swarm pas over the caterpillar spine these draw up their forepart with a jerk and a suddenly lower it again and that is all the intruder forthwith decamp nor do the latter seem to contemplate any harm they refresh themselves on the honeysmeared strip they come and go tumultuously their short flight may land them now in one place now in another on the browsing herd but they pay no attention to it what we see is casual meeting not deliberate encounter in vain i change the flock of caterpillar and vary their age in vain i change the squad of parasite in vain i follow event in the jar for long hour morning and evening both in a dim light and in the full glare of the sun i succeed in seeing nothing absolutely nothing on the parasite side that resembles an attack no matter what the illinformed author sayillinformed because they had not the patience to see for themselvesthe conclusion at which i arrive is positive to inject the germ the microgaster never attack the caterpillar the invasion therefore is necessarily effected through the butterfly egg themselves a experiment will prove my broad jar would tell against the inspection of the troop kept at too great a distance by the glass enclosure and i therefore select a tube an inch wide i place in this a shred of cabbageleaf bearing a slab of egg a laid by the butterfly i next introduce the inmate of one of my spare vessel a strip of paper smeared with honey accompanies the new arrival this happens early in july soon the female are there fussing about sometimes to the extent of blackening the whole slab of yellow egg they inspect the treasure flutter their wing and brush their hindlegs against each other a sign of keen satisfaction they sound the heap probe the interstice with their antenna and tap the individual egg with their palpi then this one here that one there they quickly apply the tip of their abdomen to the egg selected each time we see a slender horny prickle darting from the ventral surface close to the end this is the instrument that deposit the germ under the film of the egg it is the inoculationneedle the operation is performed calmly and methodically even when several mother are working at one and the same time where one ha been a second go followed by a third a fourth and others yet nor am i able definitely to see the end of the visit paid to the same egg each time the needle enters and insert a germ it is impossible in such a crowd for the eye to follow the successive mother who hasten to lay in each but there is one quite practicable method by which we can estimate the number of germ introduced into a single egg which is later to open the ravaged caterpillar and count the worm which they contain a le repugnant mean is to number the little cocoon heaped up around each dead caterpillar the total will tell u how many germ were injected some by the same mother returning several time to the egg already treated others by different mother well the number of these cocoon varies greatly generally it fluctuates in the neighbourhood of twenty but i have come across a many a sixtyfive and nothing tell me that this is the extreme limit what hideous industry for the extermination of a butterfly progeny i am fortunate at this moment in having a highlycultured visitor versed in the profundity of philosophic thought i make way for him before the apparatus wherein the microgaster is at work for an hour and more standing lens in hand he in his turn look and see what i have just seen he watch the layer who go from one egg to the other make their choice draw their slender lancet and prick what the stream of passersby one after the other have already pricked thoughtful and a little uneasy he put down his lens at last never had he been vouchsafed so clear a glimpse a here in my fingerwide tube of the masterly brigandage that run through all life down to that of the very smallest '"
